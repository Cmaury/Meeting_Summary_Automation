WHEREAS, unless it receives new funding from the state, Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) has announced catastrophic cuts in fixed route service of up to 35% with an additional 9% increase in fares; and,
  WHEREAS, the impacts of the possible cuts on disabled riders would be even more profound, with paratransit service cuts of 62%, and fares increased by 20%; and,
