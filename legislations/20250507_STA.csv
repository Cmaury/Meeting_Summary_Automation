(Sent to the Planning Commission for a Report & Recommendation on 12/18/24)
(Report and Recommendation received 2/21/25)
(Public Hearing held 6/18/25)
  Body
The Council of the City of Pittsburgh ordains as follows:
  Section 1. The Pittsburgh Code of Ordinances, Title Nine: Zoning Code, Article III: Overlay Zoning Districts, Chapter 907: Development Overlay Districts, is hereby amended at Section 907.04: IZ-O, Inclusionary Housing Overlay District, as follows:
  907.04. - IZ-O, Inclusionary Housing Overlay District.
  907.04.A                     IZ-O, Inclusionary Housing Overlay District
  [907.04.A.1]                     General Boundaries
[The specific boundaries of the Inclusionary Housing Planning Overlay District (IZ-O) are mapped as a supplement to this Section and as an amendment to the City's Zoning District Map, in accordance with Section 902.03.]
  907.04.A.1[2]                     Need for [Zoning Overlay] Inclusionary Housing
[The] Inclusionary Housing [Planning Overlay District] is necessary to increase the production of affordable housing to meet existing and anticipated housing and employment needs and to provide a diverse range of housing choices within the [District boundaries] City of Pittsburgh. The [updated] zoning will provide adequate balances by ensuring that the neighborhoods can elect to encourage the creation of inclusionary housing within their boundaries and continue to offer new housing units at a variety of price points.
  907.04.A.2[3]                     Purpose and Intent
The intent of the Inclusionary Housing [Planning Overlay District] provisions is to promote the public health and welfare by empowering neighborhoods to encourage and evaluate the creation of inclusionary housing within their boundaries, thereby increasing the supply of affordable housing for a range of family sizes and promoting economic integration [within the District boundaries] throughout the City. [Due to the unique circumstances involved with development within this area, the existing zoning mechanisms do not serve to carry out the purpose and intent of Chapter 901 (General Provisions) and all provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, t]The intent of the Inclusionary Housing provisions [IZ-O] is to encourage quality, economically-balanced, and neighborhood-appropriate development by:
a)                     Leveraging development pressure by connecting the production of affordable housing with the current market production of housing units;
b)                     Encouraging diverse and balanced housing available for households of all income levels and ensuring that when developing the limited supply of developable land, housing opportunities for persons of variety of income levels are provided; and
c)                     [Utilizing sites in IZ-O as opportunities to build mixed income developments. Because remaining land appropriate for residential development within in the IZ-O is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be developed into housing units affordable to low and moderate-income people.] Empowering neighborhoods to participate in the process of permitting creation of inclusionary housing within their boundaries.

  907.04.A.4                     Adoption
Neighborhoods, as designated by the Department of City Planning and identified on the City Zoning Map, may elect to adopt inclusionary zoning within their boundaries to encourage the creation of housing subject to the standards of this Section.
  When promulgating rules and procedures for the adoption of inclusionary zoning by neighborhoods, the Department of City Planning must require the performance of a Housing Needs Assessment for the neighborhood which is requesting to be included in the inclusionary zoning district. The Council of the City of Pittsburgh, based on recommendation from the Planning Commission, must ratify the applying neighborhood’s adoption of inclusionary zoning within its boundaries and must hold public hearings in the manner prescribed for any amendment to the City Zoning Code and Map.
  Once a neighborhood elects to adopt inclusionary zoning within its boundaries, the Department of Cit Planning must perform a Housing Needs Assessment every five years from the date of adoption. The performance of this assessment will occur in conformity with the same rules and procedures, including requirements for public hearing, promulgated by the Department for the initial adoption of inclusionary zoning in the affected neighborhood. The purpose of performing this assessment is to determine the amount of affordable housing created by the adoption of this zoning within the neighborhood’s boundaries and consequent need for such housing in this neighborhood.
  Housing developments in districts of the City of Pittsburgh subject to any City specialized tax abatement program (i.e., a targeted abatement program that is unique to a particular neighborhood or City area, as opposed to being available City-wide as authorized by the Local Economic Revitalization Tax Assistance Act or Transit Revitalization Investment District) are exempt from the standards of this Section.
  Any projects being built outside of inclusionary zoning neighborhoods may elect to follow the standards, funding, and development bonuses set forth in this Section at their discretion.
