        "• Pittsburgh City Council officially declared May 3, 2025 as \"Mrs. Joan Smith Day\" to honor a beloved community leader who died on that same date at age 90.\n\n• Mrs. Smith was a longtime resident and leader in Pittsburgh's Knoxville neighborhood, particularly known on the \"400 block of Zara Street\" which is famous throughout South Pittsburgh as a political powerhouse.\n\n• She served for decades as the committee woman for the Thirtieth Ward, District 2, where she helped neighbors and encouraged everyone to vote regardless of their political party.\n\n• Mrs. Smith successfully fought to get a crossing guard for the Knoxville area to help keep residents safe.\n\n• She was born in Pittsburgh on November 26, 1934, and was known for being stern but honest, with deep loyalty to her family and community.\n\n• Mrs. Smith was very active at Rodman Street Baptist Church, where she served as Superintendent of Sunday School for many years.\n\n• She died peacefully in Savannah, Georgia, surrounded by family, and is survived by her husband Greg and children Rosalyn and Mark.\n\n• The proclamation was sponsored by Council Member Bob Charland and all other council members, and it passed with full support.\n\n• Before her death, Mrs. Smith passed her community leadership role to her friend Julia Morris, who continues advocating for the neighborhood.": "S5",

But when she applied through the Pittsburgh Land Bank, she learned the votes were already in to reject her application\n\n• **The Farm's Impact**: Speakers said Evans has grown and given away over 12,000 pounds of food since 2020, with more than 5,300 pounds distributed in 2024 alone. The farm serves the Manchester community, which struggles with food access\n\n• **Community Support**: More than 20 people spoke in favor of Evans, including neighbors, board members from food organizations, and volunteers. They described the farm as a place where children learn to grow food, seniors find community, and people in recovery find healing\n\n• **The Conflict**: The land is reportedly planned for affordable housing development. Speakers argued this creates a false choice between housing and food access, saying there are plenty of other vacant lots in the city for housing\n\n• **What Supporters Want**: Residents asked the city council and mayor to override the Land Bank's decision and sell the property to Evans so she can continue feeding the community and teaching urban farming\n\n• **Background**: Evans has a master's degree, taught in Pittsburgh public schools for over a decade, and runs farming programs in multiple neighborhoods including Manchester and Sheridan": "S7",

        "• Pittsburgh City Council referred a resolution to the Innovation, Performance, Asset Management, and Technology Committee for review\n\n• The resolution would authorize paying RPC Video $6,198 to extend the warranty on City Channel's control room video switcher for one year\n\n• Councilwoman Deborah L. Gross presented the resolution during the meeting\n\n• If approved, the money would come from the city's Innovation & Performance budget account\n\n• The resolution needs committee review before the full council can vote on it\n\n• City Channel is Pittsburgh's government television channel that broadcasts city meetings and other public programming": "S9",
        "• Pittsburgh City Council withdrew Resolution 2025-1848, which would have sold two city-owned lots on Penn Avenue to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for $1.\n\n• The property is located at 2608 Penn Avenue in Council District 1 and includes Block 25-P, Lots 11 and 12 in the city's 2nd Ward.\n\n• Under the proposed deal, the URA would have marketed and sold the property to private buyers, then given the city 20% of the sale profits after subtracting their costs.\n\n• The sale required the mayor and finance director to first sign a cooperation agreement with the URA that would spell out each side's responsibilities.\n\n• The URA would have had 60 days after selling the property to pay the city its share of the money.\n\n• The resolution was presented to council but then withdrawn before any vote could take place.\n\n• The withdrawal means the city will not transfer the Penn Avenue lots to the URA under these terms.": "S10",

        "• Pittsburgh City Council created a task force to find long-term funding solutions for the Pittsburgh Land Bank, which helps manage vacant and abandoned properties in the city.\n\n• The Land Bank is facing serious money problems - its funding dropped from $10 million in 2021 to $3.5 million in 2024, and it could run out of money after 2026.\n\n• The task force will have up to 9 members, including leaders from the Land Bank, City Council, the Mayor's office, and city budget departments.\n\n• A smaller 4-person steering committee will coordinate the work and meet regularly to keep things moving forward.\n\n• The task force's job is to study how other cities fund their land banks, look for new sources of money (both public and private), and recommend ways to keep the Land Bank running long-term.\n\n• The group has six months from their first meeting to give their recommendations to City Council and the Land Bank board.\n\n• Council Member Wilson sponsored the resolution, with support from Council Members Lavelle and Strassburger.\n\n• The Land Bank plays an important role in neighborhood improvement, affordable housing, and turning abandoned lots into useful community spaces.": "S14",
