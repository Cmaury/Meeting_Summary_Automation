And I'm Anthony Coghill, I'm the public safety chairman, council representative from district four, And again, we're here to address the fleet of EMS, police and fire. And if we could just go down the line and introduce ourselves And we'll start there, And I think Marty is supposed to be here too, from police, but so, okay, Hi, Derek Lincoln, I'm with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. I'm the fleet coordinator. Okay, great. Brian Kukula, assistant chief operations Bureau of Fire, America crest. Chief of Pittsburgh emergency medical services. Deputy Chief trammel, Pittsburgh EMS. Great. Well, I first of all, I want to thank you all for being here. I think most of you were here, I don't know if you were here. there, We did this two years ago. we had a, we had a post agenda on the entire fleet, if you remember, because we had concerns in 2023 And we still have concerns today And we just want to be transparent and make sure that the public knows issues with whatever they may be, in each department. Let the record show that we've been joined by Councilwoman Barbara Warwick. Thank you for being here. Councilwoman and Councilman Bob Bobby Wilson. Thanks, Bobby, Appreciate you being here. Yeah, So, So, So, yeah, if you'll just start by introducing yourselves and we'll go from there. I'm sorry We're also joined by Councilwoman Tracy Kale Smith, Sorry. Good There, Derek Lincoln, I'm with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. I'm the fleet coordinator. Brian Kukula, assistant chief operations, Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. I'm Eric Gilcrest, chief of Pittsburgh Emergency Medical Services. Jeff Trammell, deputy chief, Pittsburgh EMS. Okay, Thank you all for being here again. As I was saying, we had the post agenda in 2023. I serve on the Equipment Leasing Authority Board, so you get to see all the acquisitions that we make, or the ones that we don't make, At the record. now that we are also joined by Councilman Bobby Charlene. Thank you, Councilman, Glad you're here. And before we get into questions, I just wanted to kind of go kind of brief us on on our last post agenda, Right? So I was really concerned two years ago about the fleet and the lack of investments that the city of Pittsburgh has been putting in, And it's not just the last three years, It's probably the last 23 years or so. Right, We're in a big hole And, if I recall, each department at the time kind of was in- I think dire straits was the word that I heard, And you know we were. we were very, very concerned about the fleet, And I know that we still are. I will tell you that not much has changed on the financial end. In fact, it's gotten worse. you know, and what prompted me to call this post agenda was two things. First of all, whether it was overreported or not- And Chief Gilchrist, I saw you on the news, You handled yourself very well as far as that ambulance in my district on its way to a cardiac arrest, I believe in Carrick, out of caution, From what I understand the drivers, you know light came on and you know they didn't. they didn't want to take the chance. So I thought that was great. It was the right thing to do. Fact is, we don't want any lights coming on anymore. We were trying to avoid that, And if we had old, brand new ambulances, I don't think that would be an issue, Which is what we should have. We've neglected the fleet for far, far too long And again, it's not even just this administration, but ministrations beyond this administration. We've been neglecting the fleet forever. Again, I'm on the Equipment Leasing Authority Board. I saw the five year outlook and it's not pretty. I don't know if you know what it is. but you know, typically for the past- since I've been here, seven years- we've been investing, I want to say, anywhere between 10 and 15 million dollars In our fleet. So the outlook for the next five years is basically three million dollars a year. So I hope what you have is adequate to get us through to 2030. But that's what I want to hear from you as to you know where you're at and how you feel the state of your fleet is and what immediate emergencies that we need to take care of, which you know we need to address and find money one way or the other to purchase any vehicle. So you're going to have- and it goes beyond public safety, Of course- it goes to public works, It goes to every department. We have vehicles in every department and each one of these departments are hurting. However, I want that being on public safety chairman, and that these are lifesaving vehicles. We wanted to address this first. The public has concerns as to you know we're going to be able to, you know, be able to pick up people in emergencies or get to emergency situations. So come on up here, director, if you, if you would. Director Lee Schmidt is joining us. He thought he was going to get away, But yeah. so, director, I just gave a quick briefing of our last post agenda and the condition of the fleet then was not good. The outlook now is probably- I'm sure they haven't gotten any better, but certainly the funding has not gotten any better, And that, to me, is really my main concern. So so, if you'll just each one of you take from your perspective departments, just give us a brief overview as to like what you immediately need, and then we'll go into questions from council members. OK, so let's start with you, Derek. Good afternoon, Councilman. Right now the police fleet is looking pretty good. due to the 2223 acquisition of all the cars from the Gopay. We've purchased 60 cars, which have been most of them have been put in service. I still have approximately 30 of them that are being upfitted at this time. We also got 22 command staff vehicles that have been purchased for of them or in service, and the other- I believe it is 18- have not been put into service as of yet. We also have ten new motorcycles that have been purchased. Five of them have been upfitted and the other five are being upfitted at this current time. So we have decommissioned a lot of the older vehicles. The oldest vehicle I have is like 2016 with 120,000 miles on it. The rest of them are well within their lifecycle. So we're looking at the next five years to see how that goes. Currently, All right. Well, Derek, I appreciate that And I know if any place we made progress was with the police department. you know, in the cruisers that we purchased- you said 60 sets, 80, some vehicles that we purchased there Right, Which you know, of course we needed and we, we made that motion to do that And I was very, very active in lobbying for that. I will say Again, I'm a member of equipment leasing authority board, but I haven't been there for a couple of years. When The next five years, I just kind of threw my hands up and, you know, felt like the will is not there to put the necessary funding in the vehicles. So I count on Peter McDevitt, who's here. He's also on the equipment leasing authority board. He keeps me apprises pretty much as everything goes on. So, OK, Brian, Yes, thank you. I'm not going to paint as rosy of a picture as the police bureau is And I'll start by saying that our oldest vehicle is 37 years old. Wow, In fact. here's a breakdown of all the of the fleet In all the different categories that can identify ages of the vehicles. There's been some successes in purchasing vehicles over the years. But what's happened in the fire apparatus industry for for a multitude of reasons, but delays in the Delivery times and build times have gone dramatically longer than normal. So we can assume that that if we were to order a pumper it's going to take two years from the date of execution of a purchase order or our lead up time, And that is is between nine and six months, But two years to produce that. a ladder truck is four years. A special operations vehicle is four years, A command vehicle year, year and a half. We have not replaced command vehicles in the last two years. A lot of them are well beyond their effective lifecycle. We have identified what is our, what is our desired state for years in service, years in reserve, And we are well exceeding that in in multiple categories When we have frontline pumpers that are 14, 15 years old and aerials that are 17, 18 years old. If we were today, we would not be able to see those vehicles. We would not be able to see those vehicles. We would not be able to see those vehicles. We would not be able to see those vehicles And the maintenance costs that go into supporting those vehicles is is really, And I would say that OMB is going to give us and fleet would give us the best perspective on that. But we're at times spending bad money to repair vehicles that should have been replaced ten years prior. Well, thank you, Brian. I just want to say I don't want anybody sugarcoating anything. Thank you for your honest assessment. This is about transparency, to say the public knows that what condition our fleet is actually, And I claim to know some what, but nobody knows better than you all. So we'll get into that more as questions come about. So I guess, Director Schmidt- I don't know if you want to say anything before we go to Miss Gilchrist or not- It's up to you. No, I mean you and I know I've had many discussions about the fleet. I think it's been disinvested in for decades. I think the city has to take a look at that, how we invest in our fleet on a regular basis. I've said it fairly publicly. I think we need a significant sum of money annually, probably- at least you know- 10, 15, 20 million dollars a year, in order to stop this cycle of where we either wait until we get an influx of money, we get grants, et cetera. But I think we have made significant progress over the past few years: ordering vehicles, getting the police fleet up, ordering ambulances, ordering fire trucks. I know we just recently placed an order for some ladder trucks. We have some pumpers that are on order, But, as Chief Coquilla said, especially post-COVID those, the number, the time it takes to get those vehicles is significant. And then I'll let Chief Gilchrist talk about EMS as well. It's the same thing. We can order a vehicle today, but we wouldn't expect delivery of it for two years or so. Mm, hmm. First of all, thanks for having us and listening to our pleas here. Just as Chief Coquilla sent you a some documents of our fleet, I'm going to provide that with you as well. Those are the ages and I don't have enough for everyone. Could you just hand these down And then to: Oh, thank you, So you'll see all the vehicles that we have in our fleet. They're there, They're dates that they were manufactured, when they were put in service. So you can see the age that we're end of life with a lot. I'm just going to go through real quick some things that I jot it down. Just I just want to say that this is a very important event for us to give you more of a better glimpse of what we're facing at this time. in 2015- That's as far as we've gone back. 2015- We were not allocated for any paramedic, which is ALS units. 2015 and it's now 2025- We did get two special event trucks- Those are smaller- that we use to service the venues around the city We're now using. the new vehicle is a 1982 vehicle. That's a trench truck. It is not used often. Let me just preface that the last time it actually went out was during the bridge collapse. It wasn't utilized then, but you know it still runs. It's a very old vehicle. It does need to be replaced. The second oldest truck that we have in our fleet is a 1987 and it's our scuba truck that was slated to be replaced in 2015. However, that money was reallocated This Somewhere else, So we didn't get that. 2016: No ALS ambulances. 2017: 2018: No ALS ambulances. I'm sorry. 2016 and 2017: We didn't get slotted for any ambulances. 2018: we received. for 2019, We received three. 2020 is where you really start to see how bad COVID hit the city of Pittsburgh. We were supposed to get Two ambulances. Well, sorry, we were supposed to get five. I can't understand my notes here. I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry. We were supposed to get three, but we only ended up getting two. In 2021, we didn't get any ALS ambulances. We did get two. We did get two. We did get two. We did get two EMT trucks, which are the smaller ones for the BLS units, for the EMTs. In 2022, we were due to receive two ALS ambulances and we just received those two in January of this year. Those are the two that become the hot button topic of the news story. That was medic eight, medic 14. One fallacy in that interview was the fact that those were delivered. They were delivered on January 20th. 25. Any ambulance that comes from the dealership is not ready to be roadworthy. We have emails for months just for proof that in January they had to be sent out for radios. There were oxygen compartments that needed to be moved. There were other modifications that needed to be made to these trucks, So it's a fallacy. It's a fallacy. It's a fallacy that they sat at the garage for three months. The the issue where the ball was dropped approximately three weeks. They were not. An application was not turned in for them to be inspected. However, we just found out that had those vehicles been on the road they would have broke down. Why? Because whenever they were upfitted they were remounts And the Hoses that connect the back or whatever were too short. It was discovered. Was it yesterday? It was. It was actually discovered yesterday when they pulled Medicaid in the sorry medic 14 into the garage to put samsara in it. After they installed samsara they noticed a cool and a puddle of colon under the vehicle. The way the remounts went, they the colon hose. they made it too short and it ended up Rubbing up against a fan and it started just wearing a hole into the fan. I actually have pictures of it from the garage. They were able to completely fix one. They had to build a separate bracket. Medicaid was actually at EMS office getting some changes to it And it went back down to the garage and the garage looked at that one as well And they had to do a modification on it, the same as medic 14. So if those trucks would have been on the road they would have broke down at some point. Unfortunately, They are fixed Thanks to the garage. They will be able to go for state inspection tomorrow between 9 and 12 to EMS West to get the certification that they need, And I do have actually pictures on my phone to show you. so it is unfortunate when these trucks come in. It was a brand new truck and potentially could have caused harm if it was out in the field, Not justifying the application Not being submitted to. to further, those two ambulances we were due in 2022. Like I said, they came in January of 2025. In 2023 we were supposed to get five ambulances, two of which were new and three were remounts. For whatever reason, that number was reduced So we were no longer getting two new ones, but we were getting three remounts. Of course, those were not even in production right now. 2024 were owed two ambulances and in 2025 were owed one ambulance, which are out for bid now. also, I would like to point out the fact that- and I do have to give trans dev our, our fleet vehicle service, a shout out- Dwayne Gohecki. he got hired several times. He got hired several years ago and he recognized from his background in automotive services that our vehicles should have been counted by engine hours instead of mileage. my deputy can let you know how crucial that is, because an ambulance that looks like it has low mileage on it actually has double or triple. So if you want to expound upon that, we schedule weekly the engine hours for the vehicle so they can go down for preventive maintenance or inspection. it's done every week. the schedules made between Dwayne and I to get the units down there. some of the older vehicles are done by miles. The newer vehicles are primary units to Ford 550s that we use for our medic units. they go by hours, not mileage. so Ford recommends- and I don't have Reasoning behind it- I just have its multiplied by 20. So we have one of our units that are from medic for it's a 2019. It has 15,000, 375 hours on it. Multiplying that by 20 It's 307,000 miles, 500. So some of the vehicles- 343,000 miles, 760 and sorry, I just got this calculation a little bit ago So I didn't do all of them. the point Is we have vehicles- If you were going by mileage they'd be over 300,000 miles, multiple of them. So they are on their last legs And I again the city garage. they do their best to keep these vehicles on the road And let me say we have transdev here. at some point We're probably going to ask you to come up with kind of crowded up here now. But you know I want to talk further about what it's costing us to keep these older vehicles on the road, which is, I mean, we did see the repair costs of the council members did see repair costs a little bit ago in general of the fleet And it's just astronomical. Obviously, the older the fleet and harder is to find parts, the more costly it is to fix them. So I want to be clear with the public and with the press and whoever else might be listening. This is not a reflection on you or your departments. Okay, In fact, it is reflection on this council and the administration. I will tell you right, because we are the ones that fund it, We are the ones that have done it. We have approved or reject the funding. We've obviously been negligent. I feel like at our job and you know I sometimes can't sleep at night when I know ambulances and fire engines and any amount of time it takes, once we do pay for them, to actually receive them. So so you know I don't want to scare everybody in the city of Pittsburgh, but there are reasons to be concerned And it all starts right here, at this table, with this council and the administration, whether it's this administration, or past councils, or past administrations, That's, who has failed and let this city down in our vehicle fleet? Okay, Well, you're always, always lobbying for I know more readily better, newer vehicles. So so I just wanted to be clear. This is not a knock on the department heads at all. In fact, you know, if anything- especially me- I'm on the equipment leasing Authority board, So I was very well aware- is the lack of investments we've been putting in, and- and it's the next four or five years- is almost comical, I will tell you, you know, basically, what it says is: None of you are getting any new vehicles with the amount of funds we have set aside, nothing, So, anyway. so with that, you know, let me open it up to members, and if you all have any certain time constraints, any, which one of you will go in that order? or we could go with how we, how we came, and that would be our former president. councilwoman kill Smith: No, no, go ahead. Oh, you don't want to go first? No, Okay, who would like to go first? councilwoman Warwick, I have to be able to respond. Okay, Sure, Yeah, I mean, I'm, I don't have to too much, I agree, Oh, sorry, Yeah, So thank you. Thank you all for being here. I don't have too much. I did just for folks. I got from OMB. This is the breakdown of everything We have spent on vehicles in JD Edwards, just sort of overtime, just to kind of give folks an idea. It, you know, covers ARPA funding, bond money, which I guess we don't do that Anymore. We don't use bond money anymore, but we used to general fund money, Grants, pay, go and parks tax. This is all vehicles, not just not just public safety. So there's that and I'm happy to share this with whomever wants a copy, and then also the ELA plans from 2021, 22, 23, 24. I got these from OMB, So I'm for- I apologize- My printer, my office printer. The last page is not great, but it's just to kind of give folks an overview of what what we're spending as a city. And yeah, I mean I do want to say: well, I guess I do have some questions. just in terms of the breakdowns. Do we know, Do we have a number for how many times a vehicle, an EMS vehicle, has broken down on the way to a call, I don't know, In the past year or in the? just so we know. That's it. So I think the question is: do you have any information on that? So I have an idea. I don't have that readily available, That information. However, we do have the last couple of months of vehicle repairs here. At any given time we could have three to four frontline vehicles out. We are fortunate to have a bank of spares. So whenever the the newer trucks- the newer trucks that are old- break down- we still do not have a bank of spares, That's it. That's it. we still do have some spare trucks. they are in worse shape, but we usually have some spare trucks on hand. but it still means you got to go back and get right. so someone's sitting there waiting on the way to the hospital. okay, i understand that. okay, have we had these breakdowns in fire that you that you're aware of? fire trucks? fire trucks do break down, i mean like on the way to a fire or in the midst of off the top of my other, off the top of my head. no, in response to a fire, we've had vehicles break down on the scene of a fire, just not last saturday. saturday before, in lawrenceville we had a ladder truck have a experience: a pretty significant hydraulic leak on the scene and- and we do have great mechanics. we need more mechanics, but we've got some great mechanics that work on our fire fleet, yeah, and we have a great relationship with those folks. yeah, okay, great, and thanks for the explanation, because i saw- i see rick earl is here. so you know, and you know, hopefully now that that that the media has this new information about the. you know, like you get a new vehicle and it doesn't go out, it takes a certain amount of time for it to get what's the word right up it. right, that there's a certain period of time, so hopefully a correction will be issued on that it's. you know, that's that's the nature of of being in the press, right? you? you report the information you have when you have it. yeah, i mean again, i, you know, i i really do need to echo councilman coghill because the reality is i've been here- i think i've been here for two representatives one more time. you have to let him know what you brought a lot councilman in everyretenese road, just to verify. there's thought, or trata Walker, as i'm aware these are very harsh because i've been here a lot- that i think that the traffic is coming quite far for us. yes, so of budget seasons, and I think both times. you know we have these pre-budget meetings right, where you all, each department, comes in and sits down with council members in the briefing room and sort of gives us, you know, the administration does their version one of the budget, which is the draft, right, and then you all come in and this is, by the way, this is all departments, not just you know, and we're there and you say, hey look, this is what we asked for, this is what we got, and I distinctly remember, I think two years in a row, you know, hearing about this ambulance issue. so you know again, you know council does control the purse strings, right, and when it comes to that final budget. so you know. but there's also a lot of things. so you know there's always. and also, that you can't use bond money is my understanding now. so it's sort of like, what is it in the operating budget? and I'm not asking this to be glib, it's actually something that you know we should all be thinking about, right, because this obviously is an issue. it's been in the media, a lot folks are concerned about it, so that it does beg the question: what you know, what do we not do, right? what do we not do? is it an operational budget? just to be clear, that's like our you know salaries for the most part. So yeah, I mean budgeting is difficult and I thought it was 22 million. I think we had a post agenda before with the ELA and I thought that the yearly like comfort zone place would be about 22 million. but you know, I understand. so when you say 10 to 15, is that just for public safety? Yeah, Yeah, at minimum, yeah, Yeah. so the overall, if I remember from that, is 22 million a year. I mean that's, that's a lot of money, you know. so it's, these are, these are hard questions. it makes you know that's what makes our job difficult is kind of figuring out how to stretch these budgets thin. you know you don't wanna raise taxes, obviously that's. and you know I will say, and I, and you know I gotta go actually pick up my phone, my kid, after this. but you know we talk a lot about these non-profits. you know, and i've heard this, i've heard this sort of you know in, in around the election and whatever. and you know upmc we're, you know ahn, these ambulances are taking people to your hospitals, you know like, but i don't know what's stopping them from writing a check today. i mean, i understand that this is a negotiation whatever, but this is a negotiation that's been up in the air since i don't even know when. right, like how many, may you know, like the mayor before, and it was going to be a thing. and then now this mayor, and now you know, oh, maybe the next mayor, like come on, when's it going to happen? right, like, these vehicles specifically are, are getting people to your hospitals, and if you've got money to contribute to the health care system, you're going to have to pay for it and you're going to have to pay for it, and you're going to have to pay for it, and you're going to have to pay for it, and you're going to have to pay for it and you're going to have to pay for it. now would be the time. right is a gesture of goodwill toward the people of pittsburgh, whose taxpayer dollars are going to, you know, help support those organizations in in a major way. so, yeah, i guess that's it. i don't have too many questions. if anybody here has anything to add, i feel your pain. like i said, we've sat in the in the briefing room and i've heard about this two years in a row now. so i think the general public does need to understand though, even though we might have a vehicle that's a 2018 or 2020, that's not like your normal vehicle. that's a vehicle that's on the road 24 hours a day. in the topography of pittsburgh is crazy, going up hills, downhills, so it that truck is actually being utilized almost every single moment of the day. it's particularly in in our bureau. we run approximately 55 000 calls a year. so, and i mean we've seen right- we just experienced a major. i mean, you know the city county declared a state of emergency. this is core function of the city is. you know our public safety services, but so are our rec centers, and so are you know all of our public safety services, but so are our rec centers, and so are our. you know all of our public safety services. you know all of our public safety services. we're we're going to need to be really careful with our. we're going to need to be really careful with our. the other goods, dpw. anyway, that's that. that's it for me. i'm happy to share these if anyone's interested in these budget numbers. you know, over the years, it's you all welcome to have them too if you're interested. so, anyway, thank you. thank you, councilwoman warwick, and i'd like the record to be shown. we're joined by our acting chief, marty devine. marty, thank you for being here. you're doing a great job, man. yes, you are. i know that because it's been so quiet and you know quiet is good in your, in your line of work. so so thank you for you know, stepping up and serving and doing such a wonderful job i did. i did want to remark, before we go to councilman kail smith, and two things. first of all, for the public and the press or whoever else is wondering, bond money is actually a loan right that we take over a 20 year or so period. vehicles do not fall under that category. i don't know if they did one point, but i know they no longer do because their lifespan is not has to be 20 years. so it's bridges and things of that nature. so, and to also what councilman work said about the upmc and the hospitals, i couldn't agree more that i will tell you. you know i'm a big advocate. we are delivering their patients. but i will tell you this: it's pretty clear to me: the reason why they are not coming to the table and the reason why we don't have that relationship is because we are suing them and you don't deal and you don't talk and you don't negotiate with people you're in a lawsuit with. so that's just the facts and the reality of it. so okay with that, councilwoman kel smith, please thank you. so just a few things. first, i want our budget director to come to the table. please, pete, thank you. and i do want to say thank you to acting chief marty devine. you're doing an amazing job. i want to thank you for the work you do. i hope we can find some way to keep you in in that role. and, chief gilchrist, i want to thank you for the work you're doing too. you'd always do, you know, i've always been a fan. but i am wondering where the chief of fire is. he's at mandatory training for emergency management. he has mandatory annual training. yes, he was here last week when we were going through all this stuff with the. he was at the major or the metropolitan chiefs conference, but he was available by phone and we have a deputy emergency management coordinator. yeah, i've been hearing a lot from which i didn't even know we had, so it's good to know. with that said, could you tell me how much money we give, allocate and grant funding or that we distribute. hi, do you know peter mcdevitt, city council budget director? so there's the public service grants. that city council has 650 000 in cdbg money and the mayor's office has 100 000 that is given out as public service grants. then at least half of the stop the violence trust fund, which is allocated at 10 million dollars, is set to be given out to. i have it right in front of me: 50 of the annual budget expenditures shall be from the fund shall be allocated to outside community-based non-governmental organizations. so those are, they're providing services, but we are. i mean you might want to, you might consider those grants, but i don't think we have enough funding to do it, because we have to look at how the housing opportunity funding money is is allocated. that all the funding. i want to look at all the funding. our budget is a mess. we are not in good financial situation right now, not in the future either, and i think we're allocating a lot of funds for things that we are not even responsible to do. i think one of the biggest things we do now in terms of providing a service to the residents is our amazing public safety department. we have the best. we have the best bureau of police in the region, and you know we can't get them to do their work to be preventive in terms of violence. when there is a shooting and somebody needs an, it needs an ambulance immediately. when there's something going on that involves fire or some kind of explosives or whatever, we need them to be able to get there, and if they can't get there, we're not only we not preventing violence, but we're not responding to our residents, and you know that. and so for me, i think i want to know what we're doing, how much is left and stop the violence funding. i want to know how much we're allocating to developers to develop. we keep talking about affordable housing. if we can't, if we can't, keep people safe in the city, they're not buying our housing, they're not moving to pittsburgh. so this is my biggest concern, i think, our budget. we've had an opportunity with the arpa funds. i don't know why we didn't use the arpa funds to buy additional vehicles to to update all the fleets- i mean including dpw, because that's also a huge concern. we had them in, you know, recently responding to stuff and they had they got stuck in their vehicles, and so we want them to also have safe vehicles. i remember when i first was elected in 2009- almost well 16 years ago- back then they were- i went on a plow truck with bobby pomacina during snowmageddon and he was driving a plow truck and the plow fell off the truck while he was trying to plow the roads. he got out to put fix the plow and he had to get a nail because he didn't have a screw at the time to put it back into place and he had to bend the nail back to try to get the plow back on so he could plow the roads. in the meantime, he's answering calls on both phones and and a walkie-talkie. so that's been how long and we've known that this has been this, this bad. at this point, i blame council a lot for this, because we know what the budget looks like. i've sent emails and concerns when we were talking about the budget and our controller had the budget for three months before we got a letter, an email, saying that there was an issue with the budget, and at this point, i just feel like we need to all stop playing politics, because public safety is the most important thing that we do here. it is providing a service and response to our residents when they need us the most. and so i feel like director, i feel like we've given you a job to do, and not in all the tools you need to do it for every bureau, for every, every, every part of your, your job. so i'll leave you with that, thank you, and i'm going to go ahead and turn it over to dr billard to talk about the budget, or budget every part of your job. So I apologize for that too, because you have been very responsive and always responding to council members. so I wanna thank you for that. But for me- and we have great chiefs, all of our chiefs are great- It's not all of you, it's us, and I do think that we need to look at this budget and see what we need to do differently to make sure that we're bringing in the equipment. How long, Director, does it take to get a vehicle in? If you would order a new fire truck today, what would it take? The longest build out is a ladder truck or heavy specialized equipment, and that's four years, Four years. So, and I'm gonna say I also don't blame just council, I also blame the administration. There's a responsibility here, and you can either decide to allocate dollars to everything and every project and every thing you wanna fund, but if you're not taking care of the people, you're not doing your job either. So I feel like and taking care of the people means, I think, public safety, public works. those are some of the biggest things we do. I think we have a city parks budget that operates on a shoestring, but they do an amazing job. But when it comes down to it, these are the things that people need to live in the city of Pittsburgh, And I just would like us to look at maybe freezing any grant funding that we have, any funding that's not encumbered, anything that we can do- and I talked to you about this briefly, I think, last week. I want us to do that going forward, and then sit down and have a conversation about what we need to do to get this fleet up and running the way it should be and needs to be. Maybe we won't get it perfect this year, but we can at least start somewhere here. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Kale-Smith. Let's see what did I wanna add before we move on. I forget, but I'll tell you. We'll go to Councilman Sharlin, All right, thank you. Thank you for thank you for your time. Thank you for scheduling this And I think this is an issue that I knew was a problem coming into Council, but it was one of those things where every department brings up their issues right And it's up for us to kinda decide what the issues are. that are the issues that we can address. There's so much. there's this huge backlog of deferred maintenance that we have in the city, from this building to your fleet, to parks, to bridges and everything else to our JDE system. it's tough for us to figure out what is the thing that we need to be working on. I think the thing that was so pronounced to me was that when I met with the respective unions from all of your departments, none of them were talking to me about any sort of union to me, about any sort of union, union issues. they were talking to me about the fleet And if they've got the opportunity to advocate for anything to council members, what they're advocating for is the fleet. I see, Tim here. what we've talked about in fire- having SUVs be what are staffing the fire stations after a truck goes down- that's woefully unacceptable. I understand that we as council, we have to make those decisions of what we prioritize, but we can't have an SUV responding to a fire call. And when I see Medic 8 serves a good bit of my district- I see all these other trucks that are in where Medicaid should be And I can't say why that's happening, but I know that that isn't the right truck for the right spot. So something's up, That's a problem, And I think that we need to see this as like. this is our biggest problem, our biggest gap here in our budget that we have to find a way to solve here. So I wanna ask, kind of, if the three different departments or bureaus can respond: who are your champions? Who's championing your causes? Who's your leader? Who's your general manager? I guess I'm looking for a little more clarification in your question. So when you know how bad the fire truck situation is, who is it that you're going to to say this is our problem? Who's championing for you Is it? We've presented an assessment and recommended fleet replacement to two different departments And you're not going to have a single fire truck that takes a fire truck plan over the last three years to the ELA, and the first time that we had a post agenda, we presented it at that. it that opportunity as well. so the your the ELA is championing for you is that we are. we are advocating to the ELA what are what our needs are. we work with the Department of Public Safety to advocate that to council and the administration for incorporation in the budget. I think that it's widely known that previous EMS administration's have sounded the alarm, actually ad nauseam, with the state of our fleet. we had a pretty robust ELA presentation last year about the state of our fleet. I think the state of our fleet has been very robust and we are very excited to have it here, and I think we've sat here at the table and talked about it, particularly last year during the budget hearing, as bad as it is. the union has also, you know, expressed their concerns about the fleet. I don't think that I don't think that we've done anything more or less than we could do to understand what a council have, How it should be in, our nine out of ten ever come to live. have not I- I am as am. I would like to remove this floor- really give kudos to our fleet maintenance. They're working with the best that they have, but it's something that we're on. We are in very tight communication with them daily, so I don't actually know what else can be done. Unfortunately- and I know this is something that will not happen- but Pittsburgh EMS brings in an additional 2 million every year. We keep bringing in money. If we could just see some return on that money to be allocated to our fleet, that would be great, because we are steadily bringing in more and more revenue. We are slated to bring in about 24 million this year. We are bringing in more than half of what our expenditures are. I know that there's laws and red tape that won't allow that to be done, but so I would ask the same thing to police. Who are your champions here of getting the message about your fleet here? I know police is obviously a little bit different than the other two bureaus, but, Yeah, correct, Excuse me, I can't say what happened before. I just recently was hired into this position about four months ago, so I've kind of walked into a situation to where we had a surplus of cars that had come in. So to me it's advantageous for me to build upon this fleet that I have now and move forward. so my needs aren't as bad as it is for patrol cars or detective cars or command cars. Mine is more my special services, my SWATs, EODs, fire marshals, that type of stuff. So I need to start working on that. But going to the EOAs, who we go to and propose what we need for fleet needs, I'm trying to work some plans to where we can incorporate using some of the equipment in our current vehicles and put them in new vehicles to save money to potentially buy more cars. So that's just a plan that I'm coming up with in the future to help us rotate and not spend so much money and still be able to buy more cars. I guess what I really want to know is like, where's the communication breakdown? Like where, if you're all advocating that your hair's on fire and you're going to be able to get out of the car, where I guess it's not a good joke with firefighters but your hair's on fire and you know that we need more vehicles here But at some point that's not ending up as the priority in the budget? Like, where is the breakdown? I mean, I think there's a few things. I think we've had this post agenda annually since you've been public safety chair. When we go to the ELA meetings the unions are typically there, especially fire unions always there, EMS unions there. We have made some significant changes to the ELA, to bid out our custom vehicles to make sure we'll be more efficient, Developing a fleet aging and replacement plan, which is something we didn't really have before. And in every budget season we talk about our vehicles, The media talks about them. I think we're at a point where through the years, we've purchased vehicles through grants, which then means I have five or six vehicles that all kind of need replaced at the same time, which adds an additional thing. Another thing I think council and administration needs to look at is our current process for capital allocation. You know there's the capital review committee I know myself and other directors have talked about typically our infrastructure needs and our basic needs are not scored well in that committee because they don't have diversity impacts, They don't have economic impacts, They don't have, you know, public relation impacts that that scoring matrix currently uses. I'm not on that committee so I'm not sure exactly how it works, but based on the information I've had and the staff I've had, I think it's important to know that. I'm not on that committee so I'm not sure exactly how it works, but based on the information I've had, I think it's important to know that. I think it's important to know that You know, a lot of ELA money is capital, so the ELA is obviously not getting scored as well as it should be for what we need. I think, other than, as Chief said, screaming from rooftops or picketing or getting our unions a little more active, I'm not sure how they can get more active- Pretty active, Yeah. About this, I don't know what else we can do other than to continue to say we are trying to be as lean as we can and we can be as resilient as we can. I think other than that. I think other than that I don't know what else we can do othern we can. We're trying to make all the changes we can to make sure we are not spending more money than we need to for vehicles that we're getting, vehicles that are reasonably priced. But also, we all know- I think everybody here knows- vehicle costs have gone up significantly over the past five years. right, We've seen at least 100% increase on some of these vehicles. And then the tariffs, all the other things. some of the specialty vehicles that we have, things that we have in the emergency management fleet, the police specialty vehicles, fire, EMS- A lot of those were purchased with UAC funding, which is federal funding that's provided to the region. So then the region bought that, those vehicles and gave them to the city. But That funding has significantly Dwindled over the years. that funding was created post 9, 11 And over the past 24 years that money continues to dwindle. And now there's a potential on a federal level that money is going away completely. But that went from Forty to 50 million dollars a year to like four million dollars a year for the region, And when I say region that's a 13 county plus the city all sharing that money. So I think in the past we had other ways Of Purchasing some of these vehicles, But now it's falling more on the onus of the city. So I don't know what else we can do other than come maybe every public comment We have somebody stand up and talk about how bad the vehicles are. But I mean, we've seen news stories, we've seen- and I've been here, you know, for eight years now I think we've all asked for vehicles every year. Yeah, I'm not sure what else we can do. Pete, how do you think that we can change the Capital scoring committee so that These are priorities of the administration? Vehicles are priorities of the administration. So there is a rubric that all of the capital program. the capital budget proposals are graded off of it, Do you? We're always working with an. Do you help write that? No, I don't help write it, but I do help score it. And well, I shouldn't say that I do help write it. Dave Hutchinson, over in the capital budget team And OMB does a fantastic job putting it together And he always reaches out to our office- because me and Kirsten do score on that committee- asking for input and suggestions and changes And he's always taken those to heart And he's made some changes based off of things that we've we've noticed every year. But it's, it's always going to be, an imperfect system, Like how do you score needing a fire truck versus needing park improvements, needing landslide mitigation, needing paving, like we we have- I've said this every single year- we have, We have way more needs than we can afford to fill them. We do not have enough people to do all of the projects that we have in our capital budget. every year, I you know, we've sat at this table year after year after year And I remember asking Chief Gilchrist to repeat about having people in ambulances and breaking down, because that isn't something that we can continue to ignore. It I pointed out in my budget overview that we are Not Funded Over. We're Funded Over. We're Funding The ELA and vehicles at the rate that we need to, And we cannot continue down that path. So It We don't have enough money to fund everything. So I guess my question, though, is that we have, if we have, a scoring rubric that will continue to overlook These, the vehicle need, And that has not been changed dramatically. It is. It is As we all know. it is very hard for us to Defund A project in our districts once they've been announced. So if, For the first draft of the budget, if we can't get the ELA Expense to be- or the you know the amount of money that we're putting into the ELA to be- a high number, Then we're going to be sitting here next year having the exact same conversation, with more ambulances, more fire trucks breaking down. So What do we need to do to get the administration to To Take this seriously? now, I don't know that. I have a good answer for that. Like, half of the PAYGO budget goes towards fleet, So A lot of it goes to maintaining the fleet, not purchasing new vehicles for the fleet, though I mean there's some of it that goes towards leases, but all of the PAYGO budget goes towards fleet acquisition. Okay, What I mean is is like we're not getting, we're not move, We're not paying off the credit card here, We're continuing to pay interest on the credit card. We're not actually going to point where, like we're we're acquiring, Oh yeah, We're super far behind. Yeah, I mean, it's not. it's not necessarily that They're not getting scored high enough, It's like That is what the director just said: Yeah, But I wouldn't. I would argue that that's not actually not the case because, like, whenever you have a lot of money in the bank, you're not getting that much of it, And so We're not getting that much of it. And so I mean it's not necessarily that We're not getting that much of it. It's like: Yeah, It's like. It's like It's like a, you know, it's a, you know a lot of money, Yeah, And so That is what the director just said. Yeah, But I wouldn't. I would argue that that's not actually not the case because, like, whenever you have 40 million worth of requests, They can all get scored 100%, But you can't. We don't have 40 million, We have 12 million, And that doesn't include what we need for emergency demolitions or to to help fund some of the housing projects that we want to do Like they get scored high. You just can't fund everything And we don't have. we have very little. We have very little. We have very little. We have very little. We have very little. We have very little. We have very little. We have very little. We have, We have very little. We have very little. We have very little. We have very little. We have very little. We have very little. Yeah, I guess The purpose of a system is what it does, and we've got a system that continues to underfund our fleet here And I don't know how we can change that system. We need more money. That's the bottom line. Yeah, So I'm thinking it's not a good time. I mean, I've had, I mean I think we've had a fair amount of ludicrous decision before, Yeah, So I'm thinking it's not a good time to change the system, But I think it's a good time to actually change the system, because we're going to be cutting out an area. know how we can change that system. we need more money. that's the bottom line. yeah, it's not the scoring, it's the lack of money. all right, thank you, mr chair, thank you, councilman charlin, and you know i, i will say: i, you know, just to follow up on a couple of things that he had said. first of all, you know this city. let each one of your departments down. with the federal arpa money that we were allocated we should have, we could have bought you an entire new fleet. honestly. instead, we put it into, you know, noble things, affordable housing, things of that nature- but but here we are sitting here today with the same problem and again the. the reason what prompted me to have this post agenda again today was because two years ago, when we had this, when i felt like we were in crisis mode, i thought that we would have taken action towards improving things. but but we haven't. in fact, the next three years again are budgeting for three million dollars per year, which basically won't get any of you any new vehicles. even you, derek, you know, i know the police, we've done okay there and and getting you 60 or 80 new vehicles that were desperately needed. but can you survive on those? those around 24 7 too? can you survive on those for the next four years? probably not. yeah, so so we're going to be in a world of hurt. i will tell you. and as to what councilman charlotte said: where do we get the money in? and peter mcdevitt say: we have to find a place. it's not not going to make people happy, but we have to find a place for financing and get these vehicles ordered, because it takes years. in some cases- especially with you, chief mckayla, that you know it's- they don't even start to put them in process until we pay for them. so you know, so we're going to be in a world of hurt and we need to find funds, whether it be from different pots of money that we already have allocated for other things. but you have my commitment. i will tell you, as a council person, and so your departments can function properly, that i will vote for money to take from any which part of money that we have. so okay, let me go to councilman wilson. thank you, mr chair, and thank you for everyone coming today. appreciate your attendance so we can try and get somewhere. not so much on. you know what's happened in the past. we're all thanks for everyone here for laying that out in terms of what's been spent. but we are continually reminded that every time. you know we're in budget season- and i'll admit that there wasn't some heroic budgetary plan that i had at that time to move, you know, 20 million dollars to add to the fleet. but with that i'm wondering- yeah, i was thinking about whether or not i should start broad or get into the fleet. but i think that's a good question. this is some specifics and so i'm gonna. i think i'm gonna start just on some specifics here so i can get my bearings, because you know there were some. there were reports about essentially the management of the fleet and how you know, some things aren't getting done and and it kind of reminded me of our budget hearings, which was, i think you know i it was like you know, you were director gilchrist, you, you mentioned in there that you know that it's the fleet is breaking down, the ambulances are breaking down- so much that wouldn't even track the breakdowns. so i was just curious if we can just pick through that like what are, like what is the? i mean, i don't think that's really probably the case, right, i mean there is a track record of when it, when it goes down there, right, it was when it goes down to transdev, and i'm bringing up a photo that i took when i was down there recently and it's the. maybe you know this, this vehicle or maybe it has a name. it's the one remember i met with the, the gentleman that manages it, and it's a. this is an ambulance that they just totally gutted and they keep around so that they can continually take parts from it, and so it's kind of like a- yeah, we have several of those, yeah, this one's there, and i think it's kind of lives there in the, in the garage, and i can see some people shaking their head back in the, in the audience there, some people that are very familiar with their fleet, and so, yeah, maybe you're not hanging around the garage, but just in general, i just want to say that, like recently, i had the opportunity to go down there and just to. it wasn't about the ambulances, it was just in general, just about the fleet and just knowing that there's so much that goes into keeping our fleet running and the. you know what we're doing in terms of maintenance and i was just really wondering one, the management of the fleet, like who is? who is the person that's managing the fleet? is that one person for everyone, or is it each individual director? do you have, like someone, an assistant under you that's managing the fleet? like who is keeping track of all who's responsible for you know, for instance, the latest thing was, you know, the inspections weren't done. but that's just one example of you know some other questions i have for some, for some other departments. so, like you know, who's actually managing and overseeing? because if we're, if council's hearing, hey, there's an issue with the fleet, it's breaking down so much we're not keeping track of it, and then something like this happens, where you know some inspections were missed so we can get it on this on the street. you know, i would think there's kind of this, this overall, just overall presence of this like anxiety that everyone must have at the paramedics and fire and- and it seems like you're in much better shape, but you know, just in general, for for emergency vehicles, and i would just think there'd be so much more pressure on the fleet if we were to get it on the road and we're not going to have to put pressure on to get these, to get these things out the door and on the road. yeah, so in in public safety it varies by bureau. the police bureau is the only one that has its own full-time, dedicated fleet coordinators. that that's, that's all they do for fire and all that and it's hard. that's you, that's okay, all right, sorry for fire, it's an ancillary duty. then i think chief coquilla is kind of the the lead on, and then for ems, again it's an ancillary duty that a couple of the chiefs share. and then there is the overall fleet manager, who is- i think he's- he's behind us currently- that handles the whole city fleet and he's kind of liaison between transdev as well as the ela to to work with all the bureaus and all the departments across the city to to purchase. he's the one who has been working on the fleet and he's kind of the leader on the, the overall city fleet replacement plan, with the idea of being- i think we've all talked about this- like if we had newer fleet, we would likely put less money into maintenance, which then could free up more money to purchase more new vehicles instead of this constant band-aid. transdev has done a great job. they've made changes when we requested. they've significantly improved since my time here as far as getting things out the door, getting things done. but they're working with an older fleet, just like we are. so it is a challenge, but i don't know if any of the chiefs have anything to add to that. but if every day, as a mechanic, you showed up and had to work on junk, and i mean over, worn, run down vehicles, they're they're doing their absolute best. the mechanics that we have working in in fire do do a fantastic job. they do need some additional help and they solve. they solve problems like miracle workers with a lot of these older vehicles. if you visit the the fire side of the garage, you'll find at least one pumper that looks very similar to the ambulance that you, that you showed, and and same with a ladder truck over in the in the auction lot. we can't even sell it because we keep having to go get parts from it to keep other ones alive. so i would say that that, Yes, Do we need some more mechanics? We do. Do we need to get the mobile fleet service taking care of some of the small repairs? Absolutely, And to echo the director's point, the younger the fleet, the more we can focus on preventative maintenance. We can avoid spending the big dollars on major component failures and reinvest that money towards purchase of new equipment. So just to echo that I think the mechanics are doing a great job, but sometimes we hand them things that are well beyond their effective useful life and they're a miracle working them back together. All right, Thanks, And if the report is not accurate, please correct me, But the recent report of the inspections not being done at EMS- would there have been a better response To getting that paperwork together? if it was, if there were, if you did have a fleet person under you? No, I will say this: Ours is a very layered organization, So the one who's ultimately in control of our fleet is the deputy. However, there are several people underneath him, Our ambulance division chief, who is in charge of getting paperwork together. For It's not an inspection like a state inspection, like you would get your car inspected. It's an inspection for, through the PA Department of Health, to make sure it meets all of the requirements that are necessary for it to operate as an emergency vehicle. So it's a completely different inspection. I just want to put that out there. Yeah, that sounds more critical. Yeah, it's, it's. it's. it's definitely different. The problem comes in Where you know there were other things that the truck needed. Like I said, I have the emails here. for months It was going back and forth to the dealership to get radios put in. Sometimes there were mechanical failures. Those are things that you have to deal with when you have remounted trucks because they are not. You're remounting an old box onto a newer chassis, So the components don't all fit And then we are, I guess, a little bit spoiled in the city of Pittsburgh where we, all of our trucks are sort of standardized the same. So if paramedic a goes into ambulance to, that equipment is the exact same as in ambulance three. So you know, in a critical emergency where they have to jump in a truck and go and get on the road, they're not scrambling looking for equipment. So in that aspect Our vehicle fleet is different. So it's a. I can't give you a black or white answer because it's a layer thing. There are several different people and several different processes that our trucks need to go through to be were road worthy. So it's just not one or two or one person could not just be in charge of one thing. Does that make sense? You know, I guess I understand. You know I've been following reason why I was asking the question: just because, like at Council, when a budget season comes up, you know, the easiest answer I get from the department is like: here's the position we need. because of this, It's like: great, That's how Council can help. I can literally figure out, you know, where we can pull money, you know, or how we can redistribute funds in the city so we can like get you the resources that you need so that we can be as effective as possible. But I appreciate you clarify me About your department And so in that, in your, you know, things seems like there's a lot of different hats that people wearing. So in the scenario where we have to, right now, we have 2024 allocations in 2025, allocation for purchases, Right, And so have we like. are they? they ordered? Are they in route? No, So we actually have three ambulances allocated for 2023 that are, You know, they're not. They're not. They're sitting somewhere waiting to be like manufactured. When COVID hit, You figure how many EMS services are across Allegheny County and all the surrounding areas. Everyone put in to have ambulances. lifeline was closed, chassis, one order. So whenever that equipment came in, Now you have a flood of requests. The city of Pittsburgh was a little bit lower on the priority. on the priority, yes, we do have a large fleet, but you know there's other one other ambulance services that unfortunately are in worse shape than ours. so we got our two from 2022 just now in 2025, and the three that were owed in 2023. they're not even on the road. i mean, they're not even in production right now. i get that. i mean, i just want to focus on what we can. let me tell my question a little bit better. so those are- you mentioned the ones that we are waiting on. i totally get that. like those are ones that were just, you know, we can't control that mechanic or that company. you know, maybe if there's- i don't know, i know- in contracts we can, we can just, maybe it probably is a contract we like pull out, but we probably see the benefit of waiting so we can at least get it to us. what i'm wondering is what we can control. so you said no initially. when i asked about 24 and 25 allocations, was that referencing that? no, we haven't ordered them yet. they're out for bid. okay, they're out for bid. and when did that start? i can't really give you a. maybe probably about a month ago, and director firman can chime in. i finished the specs. i. i gave him some changes from the previous specs. they were all updated and just look at the firm. is the that you're the fleet team? yep, okay, so i, he has the the specs more than a month ago for those three units that need to go out for a bit, or if they're already out, okay, so they have the specs. and for 24 and 25: yeah, okay, for 24 and 25. and then we'll. well, then we'll go, or so that means we're gonna enter into another four unit type series and i'll go down to the tanks and then i'll go to these three units. i'll just i'll enter one every time, but it doesn't work on both of them. the else side, that, or a question, and i, my question, is: you can like, do you? Okay, I'll just go ahead. No, come up, that's great. He got down here next to the charge. Yeah, you can go down there. Need a longer table? Yeah, Director, please. Good afternoon. I'm Furman. Maurice, I'm the senior manager of fleet services. Okay, so now that it's in your court, in terms of the other specs for 24 and 25, how long is this bid process gonna take? The bid process generally takes about three weeks. Keep in mind this is an RFP. It has other steps involved that we need to complete before an order is actually placed, Okay, Such as pre-bid and post-bid meetings, so on and so forth. Okay, and then from there. if we're still waiting on 22, 23, then this'll be, I don't know, another two, three years until we get them right. Likely, yes, Okay, do we have to go up in price or at all within this bid process? I didn't hear you. I mean, do we have to go up in cost at all ever? Yes, yes, So we may see this back in council if costs go up. Yes, Okay, so thanks. And then, now that I have you at the table, this might just help with just the overall question that I have- And I'm trying to go larger from small to large- is: what are the standards and other plans, benchmarks, that, if anyone here knows, maybe the budget, people, fleet, people that other cities may have for their fleet? so that, although we are in this- I mean, I think Councilman Sharla mentioned the pay off, the credit card and there's these algorithms and there's these algorithms or calculations. it's not even an algorithm, just a calculation. okay, you're paying this month's interest. how long is it gonna take me to pay off this credit card? I think by law, they have to show that anyway now. So is there some calculation that we have on, you know, like, say, that interest is like repair costs for us like the analogy of repair costs, like: how much? like, how do we get to a better place? Like, are there any cities that use a calculation, or we use on a calculation in terms of the amount of money we're spending on, And if we, you know, devise a plan to? Yes, certainly. The fleet team has recently completed a fleet replacement scoring. The system is a composite index used to prioritize fleet vehicles based on cost, age, downtime, procurement risk and departmental urgency. It's a data-driven approach that is very transparent and very defendable. This is an in-house system that we have developed. Can you give me an example, like, of how it's worked, An example of how we're not using that score? We are, I'm sorry I'm not using the score, but I'll just let you explain because I'm just curious to know, like: is that involved in the scoring process, but through OMB or No? this system is devised to identify fleet vehicles that have met certain thresholds that are beyond beyond their service years. It's just a basic point system on a 100-point scale. The closer to 100 you get, the more critical the replacement. Each vehicle gets a score. Absolutely Okay. The entire fleet has been scored. The highest needs are, you know Well, let me just understand. So the scoring would be: I imagine the ones that are high score are the most critical for replacement, Or low score, whichever way you, you know, grade it either way, either end of the spectrum of it. imagine they're you're scoring based on: okay, it reaches this number. now we're spending more on cost than we would if we purchased a new vehicle- Certainly Okay. So how many? how many are above that in that range where we're spending more on maintenance than we are if we would have bought it new? Just as an idea, we have currently 489 units that are over age, 14 units that are over mileage and 125 units that are over both. That is about half of your fleet that are either over age or over mileage. You have about 669 vehicles that are within their life cycle. Like I said, that is approximately half of your fleet. The- I'm sorry, but the needs I guess, are identified here. Of course, there are always gonna be more needs than there are resources to fund those needs, but the system identifies the most critical units that need to be replaced. Okay, do we currently get any report like that to council? What kind of report would you like, sir? Like simply those numbers you're going over so we maybe can like wrap our heads around how I plan to present these numbers to the capital team for the funding season, budget season. I guess I just don't want us to get away with anything on this side of the table. so I'm like trying to hold us accountable here. I wonder: do you ever send- and this is on you, I'm just wondering- like No, I might put some legislation down that says, look, council gets these numbers annually, so that we can literally understand what we're doing to ourselves. If I could, just I sit on the ELA board, so I just- this is something fairly new that the ELA board has tasked- I love new things- Tests, Mr Morse, with. I think you just presented this to us this month or last month, I guess it was at our quarterly meeting. So this is fairly new. it's not something council would have had in the past, but it is something myself and Director Hornstein, who sit on there, have been asking for since we started on the board, For some better way of scoring and understanding and being able to have a dashboard that shows Yeah, and he's all about dashboards, so we will, i think, be able to have access to that. i mean, so it was our, so it was our transdev. they're all about dashboards lighting up too, but mr coghill will have access to it, and pete mr mcdevitt as well, since they sit on the ela board. i think that could also be shared with council. and of course, the ela is is public, so anything we do there is accessible to the public as well. great, i'd like to work with you and you know, director and, and you know yourself, in terms of like that fleet management score, although it's new, i mean, if you're confident in the score, it's just so that council can. we can maybe be great if we could all agree on what that report looks like, the council, so that we can just get those numbers annually, especially, you know, prior to actually, you know, budget season coming up, because you know that'll kind of give us a sense of where we're spending money, where we we shouldn't be. and then from there, i think what i'm really looking for is- i know there's a lot of going on around like who's blaming who for not putting money in in this year or that year. i think what's most troublesome to me is that we're not just being honest with ourselves about how we get out of this hole and our employers see, you know the on evidence, the source data. but itque Cher, relax, right, we all are able to see that that's trickier. you know we've got a high étan rule, which is part of what you've just been talking about, but there's a lot of acceded at using potential log elevator and and every training, training week it starts that's blasted by lower energy emissions under and introspection. there's Denver Armed sergeant post. somebody's investing in a four sociedadress or something like that. so i think a lot of recognition of League of health and how much, how much value is in that and how much is level of promise. the amount of money I've seen and the amount of money each year that we would need to allocate to get a lot that we put money towards. that may distract from the conversation of how, in the future, we don't have to raise taxes. you know, for people that can't afford to pay taxes right now, you know they need, they need their own, they need that revenue right now. so i'm just want to make sure that we're on a path to fund it at a certain sustainable level, because obviously we're not doing it here. if you're listing out, half our fleet is is overdue and then if you, if we can also, we can work on this being to see, like you know, the immediate needs of, of the emergency vehicles. but, you know, in a different category in that report, because i think you just get one over all the numbers for all of our vehicles. right, that was just emergency vehicles. no, so that is the complete fleet. yeah, that's what i mean, like it'd be. do you have a breakdown for emergency vehicles? he's got a really cool tableau dashboard. okay, well, we can do that, we can do that. but if you have some horizontal emergency vehicles, it'd be good to know that right now. but if you don't, if it's difficult to do, just we can go down like ems, fire and police. what's the what's? how do those scores? ems, oh sorry, thank you. 22 vehicles. ems over age, four units over mileage, 32 units over both. and is there a column for that score? excuse me, is that calling for that score? could i sure, let me just give me a second, but let me give you fire while we're waiting on that. okay, fire department of fire has 38 vehicles over age, four vehicles over mileage and four vehicles over. They have 69 units in life cycle. The average replacement score of those units is 69 And that means what That means they are within the watch list category, meaning we need to monitor for failure, risk or reliability concerns. Okay, I honestly realize I don't want to take up too much time with this, but we can go around and around, But this is something that I'm looking for so that we could, you know, just hold Numbers by public service department fleet. Yeah, Gotcha, Okay, Well, looking forward to getting together with you on that. And then the only other question I had at this point was, you know, due to some of the, some of the challenges that you're facing, like, are there any internal discussions on how to remedy these situations, Whether it's- I keep on pointing to- to police Cause I feel about- I'm not asking as many questions since right off the bat, you said I think we're, I think we're, I think we're much better and much better situation, But in terms of so we'll go to fire and EMS. So there are any internal conversations on on how to manage the fleet better from like management side. So we've done a great job working with trans dev to meet, or or attempt at all times to meet, our preventative maintenance intervals And we have gotten back into a good strategy with pump and aerial annual testing And- and no, no discredit towards the mechanics and the the work that they do, but there are not simply just not enough of them to manage our size of our fleet, And I think that that is a is a critical point that needs to be addressed in in both the coming coming to a solution of how can we get more mechanics working that are that are prepared to function and operate and repair fire apparatus. I think, on as far as on the EMS front, I mean, we're constantly asked to do more with less. I, I, I'm, we're squeezing blood from a turnip at this point. Like I say, you know, we're constantly bringing in steady 2 million extra per year running more calls with less resources. The, the, the, the, the, the. The only thing that I can think of, because I had heard the one news report where the union president had said things about ball tires and mushy brakes. things like that are onus. going back to daily checks that we will make sure that are being done internally. The garage doesn't know that there's ball tires. That's for the crew to know that and to know you would not take your own vehicle and ride around like that. So those are things that we could proactively do within our bureau to make sure, if there are glaring issues, that they are reported right away and they are fixed. Your question is: it's very difficult to answer. I think it's very difficult to answer. I think we have a lot of people who are very, very, very worried about the money that we are allotted and I really don't have a good answer for that. Okay, yeah, what you said was helpful, though, because I was really just asked about the internal conversation about managing the fleet And when we talk about claims about ball tires and everything so, and you said that, like are they scheduled to go in? Does it, like you know tire wear? does it not line up with when they go in the garage? I'm just trying to, If I may, answer that Weekly. every Tuesday, which I did this morning, sent to three guys to fleet management, I send them the hours, the hours of the trucks or the newer trucks, the Ford 550s that are tracked by hours. I get a report every Tuesday morning. I send that to TransDev, Usually by Wednesday or Thursday. I get a response. I get a response back that this vehicle's due, this vehicle's due and this vehicle's due. Once I get that, I look through the spreadsheet And I have them here and I have the schedules as well. I then, in turn, send it to Dwayne- I don't want to miss the manager of fleet- I'm sure that's the wrong choice- his title- But I send it to him. These vehicles are in need of your care. He sends me dates back and then I print out a sheet and then a district chief's The date, the time, the time Okay. The date, the time, the time- Okay. And then the day that the a medic unit's supposed to go down, they send it down for a PM or slash inspection. So, and I do have the printouts of the schedules here and so forth and I have a sample of what I get back from the garage of when the vehicle's needed. So the preventive maintenance is going down weekly. Schedules are going out up to a month in advance. The only problem we've noticed with a month in advance is sometimes the vehicles won't last that long and they'll go down sooner. Okay, A turbo or blow or whatever. So they are scheduled. They are scheduled weekly to go down for preventive maintenance. There is a policy, as the chief was alluding to, that came into play 2017- that the crews are supposed to do, basically a safety check. They're just supposed to look to see if a tire's flat, if the tires are bald For some reason, if it's for whatever happened between a PM, an inspection, if they notice something, they're supposed to report it to the district chief and then it'll immediately go down and the garage will take care of it. Okay, But I do have the schedules here because I figured out it would be a question that would be asked. Okay, So maybe it's just what you were talking about: implementing: just more support from the paramedics and all EMS staff in terms of, after they're done, using the vehicle to do an assessment and then report back. So is that something new you would implement or is that something that's ongoing right now? That's going to be something that there are things that you know, as time has evolved, we got out of doing. But the fact that our state, the state of our fleet, it's end of life, these checks should always be done, but we are definitely going to enforce it more. Okay, Just to make sure, when you get a call, as soon as you come in, that vehicle's going to start, that it is road worthy. So Right, that's good news. Those are things that, when you say being proactive instead of reactive, Those are deficiencies that we've identified, that we could, you know, be more diligent on. So Okay, Well, thank you and thanks for your time and thanks for keeping Pittsburgh safe. Thanks, Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Wilson. Good questions, Round two, I think, Councilwoman Chiusa-Kilchner. I just want to ask, Director, what does this do with any of our agreements if our fleet does not? you know we're not able to respond- What does it do with, like, the cooperation with Wilkinsburg or Ingram, And is there a chance of not getting agreements in place because of the condition of our fleet? It hasn't come to that yet. We haven't had Wilkinsburg out of service. That's the only Ingram is covered by in-city. Yeah, We got their vehicle, We got. did we not get something from them? We did. I mean that vehicle's been replaced since then. No, okay, I know our firefighters got the finger when they drove by, But Yeah, We did, We did. Yeah, We did. Now, that was some time ago. we took over, Yeah, Now they love them. Yeah, So that vehicle has been since been replaced. They do pay us annually for you know, the services we provide there, as well as Ingram. Luckily, because of the hard work from our fire bureau and trans dev and others, we have had very few incidents where we had to brown out a station because of a vehicle issue. There's definitely times it gets close. Chief Coquina's always keeping me in the loop on that. when that does happen, Let's me know. we're down to. you know, we don't have any spares left right now, So we all know that's getting close and tight. But obviously if we wouldn't be able to provide a service to somebody that we're charging for, they would probably have some concerns. But that has not happened yet. Okay, I just hope not. And are you having any conversations now about merging with any other bureaus now With anything, Anything in terms of public service, Public safety? No one else has talked to us now. Okay, There's a lot that call me. I told you Krafton wanted us to do animal care and control. I think Mount Oliver wanted some stuff, but I can't remember what it was. Yeah, We have. we do EMS for Mount Oliver. We recently were in the process of renewing theirs. What are their vehicles like? Same For For animal care and control For Mount Oliver, For ours, Oh, ours. They're fairly good. We buy one or two a year. That's right. Them and police are a little easier, police especially. So police. I will mention for clarification: Yeah, it sounds like we have more vehicles than we do police. Well, so police, their vehicles are their normal patrol cars, and even command patrol vehicles are paid for out of operational It's not out of capital. So that's in my budget, not in the capital budget. I found out there's a lot in your budget when I looked at it. We're looking at it really close now, Yeah, But that gives us the ability to be a little more flexible around that, Like it doesn't? the police vehicles aren't beholden to what ELA is assigned. We have money assigned for police vehicles, And, as we did, you know, a couple of years ago, we can find other funding in police and move it around. Those vehicles are much less expensive, though, than a 400,000 ambulance or a almost million dollar fire apparatus, versus a 50,000, 60,000 Explorer. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I mean we're, I mean we have to be, we have to be, we have to be, we have to be able to afford the cost of cars and vehicles. It's the same for, you know, like for animal care and controls, the same. We have gone to a standard, pre-spec kind of off the off the showroom floor kind of vehicle for animal care and control. So that's brought the cost down significantly for those as well. Okay, about you. it's about decisions. we need to make better and and- and I, talking to some of my colleagues, I think we're going to, so I think I feel comfortable about that. maybe it'll be the first time that we stood together to do make sure we're providing services to the residents and- and the reason I asked for the fire chief is because I also have a high record. I hold him in high regard too and trust when he tells me something like I mean, I'm sorry. so I would like to make sure sometimes that they're here to address those concerns or questions, and and I do. I I do think our budget is in such a really difficult situation and I heard councilman more Rick's comments about UPMC and and ahm, ahm, buying vehicles, and I think that's a great idea if we could make something like that happen. I think it's an amazing idea actually. but what I was like, can I just add something to that? yeah, I was gonna add to it too, but I don't believe that would be legal for them to do that by. you know, I don't think that would be legal for them to do that by in in the federal anti-kickback laws. that's something their attorneys and our attorney now. we're worried about anti-kickback laws, but okay, well, I'm trying to get people to pay attention to that for two years. yeah, well, that's something. it's something hospitals do take pretty seriously. I know even we have legislation coming up soon about them providing blood for us in the field, and that came up through their law department. so, yeah, I'm not saying I'm not gonna get into the nonprofit tax, yeah, all that stuff. no, but what I will say to that is that, specifically, I think it would be great. but I think it would be great. but I mean, we can't expect everybody who uses our services to also be buying us vehicles. where people use our services, sometimes- you know that's correct- we're taking them to the hospital because sometimes we don't have enough officers on the street and sometimes we can't prevent somebody from being harmed, and so there's like a catch-22. if we all pitched in together and work together, you know, for the betterment of Pittsburgh, we would just be in a much better place, and I really don't like the politics of, you know, getting involved in public safety, and so, with that said, I'm just gonna say I'm gonna do my best. when I talk about the state of the state, of the state of the state of the city, and I want to talk about grant funding. I want to talk about grant funding. I want to be very clear, that you know one. I appreciate the control of bringing a lot of this to our concerns about the budget, but I will say that when I talk about grants, I don't just mean grant funding go into the individual organizations and things like that. I mean money that we spend on developers and and everything else that we give a lot of money out across the city for things that you know we say that we need and we want and and I want and need additional housing too. you know we worked on a lot of housing in our area. but you know we don't want to talk about grant funding, for all of our people aren't going to live here if our schools are not, you know, providing a great, safe education, and they're not going to move here if we don't have basic services for our residents, and that includes, you know, trash removal, public safety and DPW and and and all the other things we do. they're so nice, that are great, but I mean it amazes me that we have vehicles for city parks, but we don't have it for some of the things we really need to respond with, and I love city parks, I cheer city parks, but I think an ambulance versus a van, you know it's a no-brainer, so, but for me, I just want you know that I'm gonna try to continue to work with my colleagues, who I have hold in high esteem, and I think that they they're hearing all of our concerns and you need to get on the street. okay, that's it for me, thank you, thank you all the work you do, sharing this committee and equipment leasing, and thank you, thank you for those comments. I did want to clear the air on a comment that was made by our director of OMB, Jake Pollock, who so elegantly pointed out that I haven't attended an ELA meeting for the last couple of years. I will tell you that was by design. I think anybody who's served with me on the ELA board knows I took it very seriously the first couple years, to the point where we had the post agenda a couple years ago, because I saw what an issue it was. when I saw the ELA board, I was a little bit more confident than I was. when I saw the ELA board, I was a little bit more confident than I was. I was a little bit more confident than I was when I saw the ELA board I was. when I saw the ELA board, I was a little bit more confident than I was. when I saw the new, when I saw the ELA board, I was a little bit more confident than I was. when I saw the new, when I saw the new budget from this administration for the next five years. I saw the new budget from this administration for the next five years. I saw the new budget from this administration for the next five years. I just kind of threw my hands, just kind of threw my hands, just kind of threw my hands up and thought this is not serious and that's up, and thought this is not serious and that's up and thought this is not serious. and that's why I don't even want to be, why I don't even want to be, why I don't even want to be associated. honestly, I'm just like I associated, honestly. I'm just like I associated. honestly. I'm just like I don't want my name tagged to the LA at this point because we're not taking these things seriously, we're not allocating the money that we should be allocating and this is none of your problems here. this is all comes down to council and the administration. i would say it comes down to five members of council. it does, and we got them now. it does, and, and we're going to do what it takes to make sure that we have money. whatever pots we have to raid, we will. i will tell you. but, director firman, what is your last name? again, maurice, director, maurice, you've worked in other cities before you came here. okay, tell me what you think about three million dollars a year for the next five years. for a fleet of our size, it is inadequate, it's a joke. it's a joke and in the most basic sense, and i'm trying to be as polite as i can about it- but if you do not increase your funding level, your fleet will be at a state of a critical point. at that point we we are already surpassing what we are in, what we are budgeting to spend to keep these units on the road. we we've fleet manager before me is sat at the table multiple times to raise awareness to the non-track, the the cost of these repairs. without some sort of intervention now, those costs will only get worse, and keep in mind that you can only repair a vehicle so long before it gets to a point where there's nothing else you can do to it. so before we reach that critical stage of of unrepair, we something needs to happen. thank you for your honesty. i really appreciate. i appreciate all your honesty in this. i really do. none of you really sugarcoated it. i did want to hear quickly from transdev if you gentlemen, or one or both of you would come up and just just want to ask: just introduce yourself. you can sit next to councilman charlotte. he doesn't bite- well, he does bite actually sometimes. but yeah, yes, now just introduce yourself. i just have a quick question for you. thank you for having me. my name's scott striegel. i'm the general manager for transdev fleet services. scott, thank you, and i know you've been out a long time here in the city of pittsburgh, right? yes, okay, over 10 years. so now, from the time when you came in, do you notice like you're band-aiding these vehicles a lot more, a lot worse to repair, repair, or i mean it's, it's, it's always been, it's been about the same? yeah, i mean, you know the age of the fleet, the miles, the condition, i mean it's just about the same. it's not gotten necessarily any worse. but you know, certainly parts, getting parts of some of your older vehicles have become more difficult. longer you guys would keep them on the roads, made it difficult for us to do our job. the hours, miles, the streets, the hills, i mean it's it's a little bit of it's called you work on all of our vehicles, including police, including police. right, pardon me, including the police department. yes, police, fire. okay, in your opinion, what are the worst conditions? is it ems, is it fire or the police? what seemed to be the worst? probably ems, fire, police, police. well, police is about the best right now. well, police will at least acquire some new vehicles for them. over the last couple of years, you know, and- and again i'm proud to say i was a big part of that, in allocating for that and lobbying with them for it- i don't think we would have gotten them, honestly, if, if we. i haven't been crying and screaming there. but again i see the new budgets and i'm like what is going on? director maurice, you said it best, you know best, you've seen other cities, you know this is a disaster in the making. three million dollars a year is just. that's not even. i mean, that's, that's just. it's not even funny, it really isn't. it's, it's kind of a joke. so, scott, anything else? did you want to add or no? how about you, you two gentlemen, our council members here? do you want to? no, i'm good, i appreciate you having disposed, thank you. thank you, councilman charlton, are you good? okay, how about you folks? anybody? i want to add some final comments here. yes, please, chief, i'm sorry, please, no, please. i just wanted to say thanks for hearing us out. it means a lot to have you all concerned about. you know what we have been talking about and it it means a lot that you called this meeting. so thank you very much and thanks for listening to us. chief gilchrist, i want to tell you and brian, both you've been the biggest advocates and you're right. i don't know what else you could do other than you know- start a picket line of some sort, but we hear you. you know, i've heard you for years now. i think now you know everybody's seeing the seriousness of this issue and i think this council's really might not make everybody happy where we're going to get funds from or how we're going to transfer them or what pots of money we have to raid, but we're at that point where we need a serious influx of money coming into all of your departments for vehicles, and you have my commitment, i'll make that hard decision. councilman wilson's always good at raiding pots and switching money around. maybe we'll find some some places there, but but but that's it for me. again, i want to thank you all for your candid, your honesty. the city of pittsburgh, the residents, deserve to know the condition of our fleet. it's, at the very simplest things that we need to provide as a city. so so thanks again, and with that i'll call into this meeting. thank you for watching. so you upon matter then talking about you, michelle."
