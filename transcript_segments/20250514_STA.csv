Agenda Item 2: Public Comment,"our next order of business is public comment. I would like to remind all speakers that rules of counsel state that comments are limited to matters of concern, official action or deliberation which are or may be before for city council, and profanity will not be permitted. Please state your name and neighborhood for the record. You will have three minutes to speak. We do not have any registered speakers, So anyone who would like to speak and approach the podium. Good morning, especially this sunshine, Little discombobulated this morning, after yesterday's meeting and discoveries about this diplomat who's out here raping one of his employees. I didn't mention his name, but I will now: Kareem Khan, chief prosecutor and diplomat of the International Criminal Court. Imagine that He's raping one of his employees, has done it repeatedly for months and they know about it and are protecting him because they think his position as a diplomat is more important than his position as a prosecutor. Really, I praise God I'm not near him. I remove his head in Jesus name, with all the love in my heart, that's what I would do to them. Lord, please return the sender and your voodoo. hex's curse sent towards me 100 million billion trillion Google clicks And whoever's sending it. Lord, please throw them into a lake of fire. We need to count our blessings. Thank you, Lord. I'm not this woman that this diplomat is raping, But to her I will say to you: Exodus 14. 14 says the Lord will fight for you. You need only to be still, Because that's what I have to be- for him to fight. all of you who know about what's going on with me, Why, when, how, everybody involved, where everything is that belongs to me, that has my real name on it. God blesses us so that we might bless others. in spite of everything that's happened to me, still happening to me, I will continue to fight to be a blessing. Psalm 103, 1-4 says: bless the Lord on my soul and all that is within me. bless his holy name and forget not all his benefits. who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thine diseases, who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies. Dear God, thank you for your blessings. Please help me to remember the ways you have blessed my life. when it seems to overwhelm me, I'm a little overwhelmed, but I'll be okay. so this woman: I will stand for her and for every woman that's being raped by anybody, regardless of their position, all over the world. I'm a product. I may be a product of incest in my family, but I will never live in guilt, fear or shame. in Jesus name, Amen. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good morning. my name is LeVon F Brown. I live at 715 Mercer Street in the Hill District. I brought this the other day and I'm bringing it back again for the homeless person who lost this and I guess it's because of the police. but here's your cup and I have your money, Even if you don't want to come in here. a lot of homeless people say they don't want to come here. I'll meet you outside. You know I come at 10, Tuesday and Wednesday, But if you come I have your money And I'm still worried about what happened to this person because you just don't really realize if you got a policeman that's beaten a homeless. they have no one to turn to, no one, no one to turn to at all. And I would like to say something to a special agent, secret agent, I admire you for coming. every day She comes. She has no home, nowhere to live. She really made her head down, But she comes every week. She's been coming for weeks and I thank her. I may not agree with everything that she says, but she is a human being and she is telling you she needs help and other people that need help. Now, Ms Hardwick, I had a problem with you Whenever she brought the homeless white man that you, while she's up here talking, you went over to him and you did something and you went back and forth. I keep telling you when the people are talking and you're we're talking and trying to think We only got three minutes and then you do that. It's very distracting. And then, when Ms Smith was out here and her and the man was talking and the one man that comes in, he do seem like he's really angry And he had said: be quiet, The sergeant of arms automatically come to him. It should be. get Ms Smith and put her back where she supposed to be. There's supposed to be 90 men up here And then you got eight like Mr Codhill. he really thinks that he's something. He says he's taking care of business. That's that willing and dealing. You're supposed to be at the table And I'm tired of coming, but I'm gonna keep coming because someone got to tell you when you're doing wrong. If you're not treating us with respect, you don't even have respect. Three minutes to get off your computers, get off your tablets, put the phone down. Don't go sit over there. You're supposed to be looking at us. Three minutes- what 360 seconds? You can't even stay that long to listen to us. but you'll talk amongst each other And you, Mr you, and Cargill always is talking. You need to stop it because it's very disrespectful. When I went to school, you couldn't talk when the teacher was talking, and that's what you're doing. I'm trying to teach you something because I don't know everything and you don't either, But I know what's happening in my community. If I tell you we could work together, we could stop some of this stuff. All I'm asking you is to listen to us. Don't read, don't play on your games or whatever. Listen to us, please. And Special Agent I, Michael, the Institute. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please, Good morning. Good morning, My name is Howard. HP Jackson Black Political Empowerment project grew up with nacp all my life in pittsburgh. i was here a couple months ago to talk about segregation in the education. now i'm going to tell you a story about me, roy irvis, great fighter in pittsburgh, and then, after he unsegregated some things in pittsburgh, pittsburgh's been mississippi with blinders on and we've been programmed. now let me give you the story about Leroy Irvus. When he went left Pittsburgh and he went to be at the Capitol in Harrisburg, be a state representative and the influence of his seed was planted for four state representatives to resurrect and come back to Pittsburgh to unsegregate the system And what it is. I always loved the Ed Ganey administration And then until until I found out it was segregated. And you know what? I was at a rally a couple months ago and we was out in Squirrel Hill and we were protesting Republicans. what Trump has shook up the world with Shook up the world. You know the government veterans, for what I represent, The disappointment is the segregation. and you find out that someone is running against our mayor and getting Trump money, Republican money, And you know what: We've already been assumed with fear in Pittsburgh, blinders of the Mississippi attitude of Woodrow Wilson, Jacksonville, Jaguar, Hoover, but Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh's been segregated from the time I was growing up. I was 12 years old. I just turned 72, May the 3rd. Let me give you a point of what I done, witnessed in Pittsburgh. And you grew up in Pittsburgh and you still got blinders on to segregate this city again. I don't want to go back 60 years. You know what I love to run a make. I've watched him grow up just going against our mayor. but it's a disappointment to find out the funding. I'm not here to see anybody buy a campaign, but I'm here about human rights. Human rights. I live in Wilkinsburg but I can't vote in Pittsburgh because of my situation of being handicapped. But you know what the disappointment is. You've got to go ahead and take off those blinders and unsegregate, like Columbus and the man that discovered the North Pole. Thank you very much. Thank you Any further speakers? There being no further speak speakers, We will now move on."

Now the legislative text makes it sound like we are giving permission to donate the steps that we own and we're going to rebuild to Port Authority, and that is not the intent. So there's a couple of quick strikeouts that I apologize, we didn't get to you today that we agreed with Domi about, Because what's going to happen is the Downing Street steps were closed and are gone. We're going to rebuild them, but we're going to flip them to face downhill and encroach like two feet onto Port Authority property, and so this legislative text is intended to create just the two or three foot easement with the Port Authority. so once we get a second look at it, we'll have an easy strikeout for next week. so if you wouldn't mind holding one more week so we can actually get the text and double check it in front of you. motion to hold one week. what? yes, thank you. second: second: so we've done in a second for a one-week hold. any further discussion? seeing none. all those in favor of a one-week hold for bill 1589, please indicate by saying aye, aye, aye, what bill will be held for one week. thanks, councilwoman."

So the bills that you're referencing today, where we are entering into agreements with utility companies when the city has a project and a utility has their asset in our right-of-way, they're required to accommodate our project. Sometimes it's more efficient for our construction crews that we're hiring to do that work and just pass along the cost to the utility company instead of having two essentially separate projects go in the in the same place, where they get in, do their work and then we get in, We just cover the actual construction. but they're, as you see here, responsible for 100% of the costs of incorporating that work into our contract. And the agreements are required by PennDOT for these projects that have grant funding within them. What type of work are we talking about? Sometimes this is utility relocations. sometimes it's just improvement to their infrastructure. BRT was coming through, even though that's not our project. we requested the utilities go in and do a betterment project so that we weren't working with PRT to install this great new infrastructure just to have something underground fail and have to tear it out. so this is sort of the height of coordination with utility companies to make sure that we're not disrupting the right of way more. more than so, if they see a main line that they let's say that the water company, they see a main line that they have on schedule to be replaced in five years, they would replace it. now. you know that's probably a case-by-case basis. that would be the ideal if they're able to, and we identify that as a potential conflict. but each of these projects is a case-by-case negotiation. once you find out what's underground when you get into the design work, Okay, And they're like. the other entities are on board with this, Because I saw Duquesne Light as well previously. Yeah, I mean, they're required to. When you have your assets in our right-of-way, you're required to do what you need to do with those assets. If the city has a project coming through that will affect that, What level of when you say required to like, what's the threshold that they would be required to? Now you're getting outside my knowledge base so I'll have to follow up with you on that. I'm just saying, You know, I think it's a Like when we, if we need them to relocate, we can make them relocate, is my understanding, Interesting What we need. one thing we need on Liberty Avenue is there's this one. this is a very Pittsburgh thing for me to do here, which is to pick out one part of the street and complain about it. There is a riser that's needed. you know it's the section between 16th and coming towards town And I just feel I almost want to see how many car accidents or missed accidents almost happen, because it's like you go down and up, You can't avoid hitting the tire. you know your tire hitting it. It's just, you know, like when you pave the road, the road continually getting stacked up, you know, continually gets higher so they have to put a new riser on the mantle. Oh, I see what you're saying. Okay, i can certainly have our utility folks take a look at it, i'm sure. but that section of liberty is that in the project let's see for the 16th going towards the bus station, so from 11th street to heron avenue. so it would okay, great, all right, looking forward to the project. thanks you. any further discussion? seeing none. all those in favor of bill 1798. please indicate by saying aye from an of recommendation."
