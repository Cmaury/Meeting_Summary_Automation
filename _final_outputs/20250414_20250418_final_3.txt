Headline 1: Pittsburgh City Council delays $1.5 million homeless shelter contract with Auberle for five weeks due to federal funding complications and miscommunication between government agencies.
Summary 1: • Pittsburgh City Council delayed a $1.5 million contract with Auberle for homeless shelter services for five weeks due to ongoing complications with federal funding rules

• The contract has been stalled since July 2024, when council members first raised concerns about federal restrictions that prevent the money from being used for tiny house communities with shared bathrooms

• Recent problems emerged from miscommunication between different government agencies about how a building would be used and who would live there

• The city administration thought the building would house one type of residents, but the county had different plans to house families in the same location

• Federal housing officials are now reviewing changes to the city's homeless assistance plan, which requires placing newspaper ads, holding public meetings, and a 15-day comment period

• The $1.5 million comes from the HOME-ARP program, which has strict rules that classify housing with shared bathrooms as "congregate" facilities, making them ineligible for this funding

• Council members expressed frustration that the delays prevent the city from quickly building affordable tiny house communities like other cities have done

• A meeting with consultants is scheduled to plan out the official process for making changes to comply with federal requirements

Headline 2: Pittsburgh City Council introduces bill to let workers earn and save more paid sick leave hours.
Summary 2: • Pittsburgh City Council introduced a bill to improve the city's paid sick leave law, allowing workers to earn and save more sick time hours

• The bill, sponsored by Council President Lavelle, would change how fast employees can build up paid sick leave and raise the maximum number of hours they can save

• Under the proposed changes, workers at companies with 15 or more employees could earn and keep up to 72 hours of paid sick time per year (about 9 work days)

• Workers at smaller companies with fewer than 15 employees could earn and keep up to 48 hours of paid sick time per year (about 6 work days)

• All workers would still earn sick time at the same rate: 1 hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked in Pittsburgh

• The new rules would take effect on January 1, 2026, if the bill passes

• The bill has been sent to the Finance and Law Committee for review before a final vote

Headline 3: Pittsburgh City Council approves $37,000 grant to pay police overtime for investigating old sexual assault cases and create a victim-friendly interview room.
Summary 3: • Pittsburgh City Council approved a $37,000 grant from Allegheny County to help police investigate old sexual assault cases

• The money will mainly pay for police detective overtime hours to handle untested sexual assault kits that have been sitting in the police property room

• About $36,000 will go toward overtime pay, while $1,000 will be used to create a "soft interview room" for victims

• The current police interview rooms are described as "cold and sterile" with just a desk and chair, which makes it hard for victims to feel comfortable telling their stories

• The new soft interview room will have a couch and comfortable furniture to help victims relax during interviews

• Some of the overtime work has already been done, including pulling reports and identifying which kits need testing, but most of the work is still ahead

• Future work will include sending kits to the crime lab, writing reports, transporting evidence, and doing follow-up investigations

• This grant is an extension of a larger grant that Allegheny County received in 2019, with Pittsburgh police serving as a sub-awardee

• Commander Laurie McCartney from Major Crimes explained that police were doing this work anyway, so the grant provides helpful reimbursement
