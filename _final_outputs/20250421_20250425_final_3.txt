Headline 1: Pittsburgh City Council holds public hearing on bill to reduce minimum lot sizes across residential neighborhoods to allow more housing development.
Summary 1: • **Pittsburgh City Council held a public hearing on Bill 1579, which would reduce minimum lot sizes in all residential neighborhoods across the city**

• **The bill aims to make it easier to build housing by lowering land requirements that currently make many existing lots "non-conforming"**

• **Current minimum lot sizes range from 8,000 square feet (very low density) to 1,200 square feet (very high density), with the bill proposing reductions of 25-40% in most categories**

• **City planning staff showed that 18-50% of existing lots in different neighborhoods don't meet current size requirements, meaning rebuilding homes would require special permits**

• **The proposed changes would reduce non-conforming lots significantly - for example, from 40% to 25% in moderate density areas**

• **The bill would completely eliminate minimum lot size requirements in very high density areas and remove "per unit" requirements that limit how many apartments can be built**

• **Most speakers supported the changes, saying they would help create more affordable housing and allow neighborhoods to rebuild in ways that match their historic character**

• **Several speakers criticized separating this bill from a larger housing package that includes parking reforms and requirements for affordable units in new developments**

• **Council members disagreed about whether to pass this bill alone or wait for the complete package, with some arguing the full approach is needed to address the housing crisis**

• **The bill was sponsored by Council Members Wilson, Warwick, and Charland and has moved to committee for further consideration**
