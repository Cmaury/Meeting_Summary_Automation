Headline 1: Pittsburgh City Council urges state to give $117 million to Pittsburgh Regional Transit to prevent 35% service cuts and route eliminations.
Summary 1: • Pittsburgh City Council passed a resolution asking Pennsylvania's state government and Governor Josh Shapiro to give Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) $117 million in 2026 to prevent major service cuts

• Without this funding, PRT plans to cut bus service by 35% and raise fares by 9%, which council members called "catastrophic"

• The cuts would eliminate 41 bus routes completely, reduce service on 54 other routes, and end all bus service after 11 p.m.

• Disabled riders would face even deeper cuts, with paratransit service reduced by 62% and fares increased by 20%

• Council members said the cuts would hurt tens of thousands of people who rely on buses to get to work, school, medical appointments, and grocery stores

• PRT serves 120,000 daily riders, contributes $1 billion to the state economy, and keeps 39,000 cars off the road

• One in four Pittsburgh households don't have access to a car and depend on public transit

• Council members pointed out that Governor Shapiro gave $153 million to SEPTA (Philadelphia's transit system) in 2024 to prevent similar cuts

• The resolution will be sent to state lawmakers and the governor's office

• Council members said good transit is essential for economic growth and attracting new residents and businesses to Pittsburgh

• All council members supported the resolution, which was sponsored by Councilwoman Warwick

Headline 2: Pittsburgh City Council approves zoning changes to reduce minimum lot sizes for residential development across all density levels.
Summary 2: • **Pittsburgh City Council voted to reduce minimum lot sizes** for residential development across all density levels in the city's zoning code.

• **The changes cut lot size requirements significantly:**
  - Very low-density areas: reduced from 8,000 to 6,000 square feet
  - Low-density areas: reduced from 5,000 to 3,000 square feet  
  - Moderate-density areas: reduced from 3,200 to 2,400 square feet
  - High-density areas: reduced from 1,800 to 1,200 square feet

• **The bill passed with a 5-1 vote**, with one council member voting no and two abstaining. Council Member Wilson sponsored the legislation.

• **Supporters said the changes will help unlock vacant land** and make housing more affordable by allowing development on smaller lots throughout the city.

• **Some council members wanted to delay the vote** to discuss it alongside other housing bills, including inclusionary zoning requirements. A motion to hold the bill for two weeks failed by a 5-4 vote.

• **The legislation keeps other building rules in place**, including height limits and setback requirements from property lines.

• **Council members disagreed about timing**, with some arguing all housing-related bills should be considered together, while others wanted to pass individual measures that had broad support.

• **The changes affect how developers can subdivide lots** but don't change what types of buildings can be built in different neighborhoods.
