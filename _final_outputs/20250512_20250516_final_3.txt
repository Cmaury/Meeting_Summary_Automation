Headline 1: Pittsburgh City Council learns the city collected $7.1 million more than it spent in 2024 but faces unsustainable spending that will drain reserves over the next five years.
Summary 1: • **Pittsburgh had a good financial year in 2024**, collecting $7.1 million more than it spent, according to the city's annual financial report

• **The city's "rainy day fund" is very healthy at $199 million**, which is twice what it was before COVID-19 hit in 2020

• **However, the city faces serious money problems ahead** - it's expected to spend more than it brings in for the next five years, which will drain the savings account

• **By 2029, the city will only have the minimum required savings left** (about 10% of what it spends each year), leaving no cushion for emergencies

• **Several revenue sources are declining**:
  - Property taxes fell $8.2 million below budget in 2024
  - Deed transfer taxes (from home sales) dropped $11.2 million below budget
  - First quarter 2025 shows payroll taxes down 16% and local services taxes down 12.5%

• **The city earned exceptional investment income of $28 million in 2024**, but officials don't expect this to continue - normally the city only earns $2-2.5 million per year from investments

• **Major challenges include**:
  - Rising costs due to inflation and potential tariffs
  - Increased debt payments in 2025 and 2026 from bonds refinanced during COVID
  - Property tax problems caused by a county assessment issue

• **City Controller Rachel Heisler warned that if current trends continue, the city's finances are "not sustainable"** and urged honest conversations about reduced services

• **The city has added over 200 full-time positions in the last two years**, though many are paid for by fees rather than general tax revenue

Headline 2: Pittsburgh City Council hears how Safe Passage program cut school violence by 27% and prevented teen homicides through student ambassadors and city-school partnerships.
Summary 2: • **Safe Passage program shows major success in reducing school violence** - The program achieved a 27% drop in total discipline events, 25% decrease in major discipline events, and 7% decrease in violent offenses in 2024 across seven high schools and one middle school.

• **Zero teen homicides in target age group during 2024** - There were no homicides among 13-17 year olds in 2024, which officials partly credit to Safe Passage work. However, two teen deaths occurred in 2025 from "gun play" rather than intentional violence.

• **Student ambassadors get paid to prevent violence** - The program employs 94 student "safety ambassadors" who earn $200 per month to mediate conflicts and interrupt violence before it spreads. All ambassadors have maintained a 100% graduation rate.

• **Program uses four main strategies** - Students learn to detect high-risk situations, interrupt violence, provide positive identities to peers, and change community norms that accept fighting as normal.

• **City, schools, and nonprofits work together daily** - Officials from Pittsburgh Public Schools, Department of Public Safety, and community groups meet weekly and respond together to threats through an alert system that notifies all partners immediately.

• **Students mediate real conflicts at school and home** - Ambassadors shared examples of stopping fights over relationships and social media disputes by helping peers understand that violence doesn't solve problems and creates bigger issues.

• **Program started after incident at Perry High School** - The Buell Foundation funded the initial effort, which later received state grants and expanded to eight schools with support from multiple community organizations.

Headline 3: Pittsburgh City Council urges Pennsylvania lawmakers to raise the state's minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour.
Summary 3: • Pittsburgh City Council passed a resolution urging Pennsylvania lawmakers to raise the state's minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour

• The resolution supports Representative Roni Green's bill (HB1150) that would create the $15 minimum wage

• Pennsylvania hasn't raised its minimum wage in 15 years, and workers' dollars are now worth 51% less than in 2006

• About 1.3 million Pennsylvania workers would benefit from a $15 per hour minimum wage

• All states that border Pennsylvania have already increased their minimum wages above $7.25

• The council also wants any new wage law to include yearly cost-of-living increases and let cities set their own higher minimum wages

• Council member Warburg said she tells high school students that no one should make less than $15 per hour in today's economy, calling lower wages "exploitation"

• The resolution will be sent to Pennsylvania state lawmakers and Governor Josh Shapiro, who has already called for a $15 minimum wage

• Other Pennsylvania cities including Philadelphia, Allentown, and Lancaster have passed similar resolutions supporting the wage increase

• The council noted that while Pittsburgh's economy is growing, rising costs especially for housing make higher wages necessary
