Headline 1: Pittsburgh City Council asks Pennsylvania governor to declare trash emergency and send state resources to help clean up the city.
Summary 1: • Pittsburgh City Council passed a resolution asking Pennsylvania's governor to send state resources to help clean up trash and litter throughout the city

• The resolution was sponsored by Council Members Charland and Coghill, with several co-sponsors initially signing on

• Council Member Charland said the city has identified more than 1,110 illegal dump sites since 2005, with over 850 cleaned up, but many more remain unreported

• The resolution states that trash problems are worst in the city's poorest neighborhoods, often home to minority and immigrant residents

• Several council members asked to have their names removed as sponsors, saying they were concerned about asking the governor to declare a "state of emergency" for litter

• Council members said they preferred the governor focus on the public transit funding crisis instead of declaring an emergency for trash

• The council voted to remove the "state of emergency" language from the resolution while keeping the request for state help and resources

• Council Member Charland said he still believes the trash problem is an emergency that requires urgent action beyond what the city can handle alone

• The amended resolution passed, asking the governor to provide equipment, contracts, and funding to help remove trash from both public and private property

• Council members noted that current city efforts, including volunteer cleanups and Department of Public Works teams, are not enough to solve the widespread problem
