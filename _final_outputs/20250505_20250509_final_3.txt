Headline 1: Pittsburgh City Council voted to hold a major zoning overhaul for public hearing that would let neighborhoods choose to require affordable housing in new developments of 20 or more units.
Summary 1: • Pittsburgh City Council voted to hold Bill 1284 for a public hearing, which would create a major change to the city's zoning rules for affordable housing

• The bill would let neighborhoods choose whether to require affordable housing in new developments of 20 or more units, rather than applying the same rules citywide

• Under the proposed rules, developers would need to include three types of affordable units in their projects:
  - 10% for very low-income households (earning 50% or less of area median income)
  - 15% for low-income households (earning 51-80% of area median income) 
  - 20% for workforce households (earning 81-99% of area median income)

• The affordable units would need to stay affordable for 20 years and be spread throughout buildings, not concentrated in one area

• Developers could build the affordable units off-site within half a mile of their main project, or pay a fee of up to $50,000 per required unit instead

• The city would help fund the affordable housing through existing programs and agencies

• Developers who follow the rules would get bonuses like being able to build taller buildings and faster approval processes

• The bill also makes changes to downtown zoning rules and environmental standards for development projects

• Council Member Charland sponsored the bill, which has already received a recommendation from the Planning Commission

Headline 2: Pittsburgh City Council approves zoning changes that cut minimum lot sizes by up to 2,000 square feet to allow smaller residential properties.
Summary 2: • Pittsburgh City Council passed a zoning law that reduces the minimum lot sizes needed to build homes in residential areas

• The changes cut minimum lot sizes by significant amounts across different neighborhood types:
  - Very Low-Density areas: reduced from 8,000 to 6,000 square feet (2,000 sq ft reduction)
  - Low-Density areas: reduced from 5,000 to 3,000 square feet (2,000 sq ft reduction)  
  - Moderate-Density areas: reduced from 3,200 to 2,400 square feet (800 sq ft reduction)
  - High-Density areas: reduced from 1,800 to 1,200 square feet (600 sq ft reduction)

• The ordinance passed with strong support, with 8 council members voting yes and none voting no

• Council Member Wilson sponsored the bill, with Council Members Warwick and Charland as co-sponsors

• The city held a public hearing on the changes on April 23, 2025, before the final vote

• These smaller lot requirements will make it easier and cheaper for developers to build new homes on smaller pieces of land throughout Pittsburgh's residential neighborhoods

Headline 3: Pittsburgh City Council discusses critical fleet crisis as half of emergency vehicles exceed recommended age and mileage limits.
Summary 3: • **Pittsburgh's emergency vehicle fleet is in crisis**, with half of all city vehicles either over their recommended age or mileage limits, according to fleet officials

• **EMS has the oldest vehicles**, including a 1982 trench truck and 1987 scuba truck that was supposed to be replaced in 2015 but funding was moved elsewhere

• **Fire department operates trucks up to 37 years old**, with some front-line pumpers 14-15 years old and ladder trucks 17-18 years old - well beyond their useful life

• **Police fleet is in the best shape** after receiving 60 new patrol cars in recent years, though they still need specialty vehicles for SWAT and other units

• **Vehicle delivery times have grown dramatically** - fire trucks now take 2-4 years to build and deliver after ordering, compared to much shorter times before COVID

• **The city only budgets $3 million per year** for fleet replacement over the next five years, which officials called "inadequate" and "a joke" for a fleet this size

• **Repair costs are skyrocketing** as mechanics work on vehicles that should have been replaced years ago, with some ambulances having over 300,000 equivalent miles based on engine hours

• **Two new ambulances delivered in January** couldn't go into service for months due to inspection delays and mechanical problems discovered during setup

• **Council members pledged to find funding** by moving money from other city programs, saying public safety vehicles are a core city responsibility that has been neglected for decades
