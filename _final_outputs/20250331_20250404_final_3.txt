Headline 1: Pittsburgh City Council approves changes to Bakery Square zoning that require 15% affordable housing in new apartment buildings with 20 or more units.
Summary 1: • Pittsburgh City Council approved changes to zoning rules for the Bakery Square area in East Liberty that will require affordable housing in new apartment buildings

• The new rules apply to apartment buildings with 20 or more units in certain parts of the development area (called Subdistricts C, D, and E)

• Developers must set aside 15% of apartments as affordable housing if they get approval and funding from the Housing Authority of Pittsburgh

• If developers don't get that approval or funding, they still must make 5% of units affordable for people earning 80% to 120% of the area's average income

• The affordable housing requirement includes:
  - 10% of units for households earning 50% of average area income
  - 5% of units for households earning 80% to 120% of average area income

• Affordable units must be spread throughout buildings and have the same quality as market-rate apartments, including appliances and finishes

• The affordability rules last for 20 years or until the Housing Authority agreement expires

• Council member Wilson said this came from years of talks between neighborhood groups, the developer, and city officials

• The zoning changes also include a separate agreement for 100 affordable homes to be built off-site in nearby neighborhoods like Larimer

• The bills were amended and will go to a public hearing before final approval
