I would like to remind everyone that the rules of council state that comments are limited to matters of concern, official action or deliberation which may before City Council. Profanity will not be permitted. After you recall, please restate your name, provide your neighborhood for the record. You'll be given three minutes to speak. Our first And actually only registered speaker is Dr Ronald Miller. Dr Ronald Miller, the Mexican War Streets, Teotihuacan, Mexico, University of Pittsburgh, theory of sports inventor and instructor and the Global Intelligence Society candidate for president in 2028 Global Information Intelligence Networknet. Concerns of council include a focus on the child and also baseball, given Mr LaBelle's will of council on Roberto Clemente in February. This is consistent with my initiative four, where I think the child must come first, locally and nationally. The Pirate opener is three days away against the Yankees 1960. the Pirates won against the Yankees Y9, P9. ninth inning- Numbers are not in the game. Number nine: Mazeroski hits a home run in the greatest game in the history of baseball, I think Roberto Clemente. in 1971, after the World Series win, fusing Espanol and English, he said this: If I was president of the United States, I would build a sports city and take in kids from all ways of life. Why not? We in the city and the country need Clemente's intense, non-slop fusion of high info and high Q intelligence. Number 21 Pirates play fused 21 information and intelligence vectors. Roberto Clemente, the thrower, strategically chose the trapezoidal geography of right field more than left field and center field because it maxed outing runners. If you have had to strike out of a five-year argument, I would like you guys to carefully why you're sticking in in training. I think you'll understand that We can tied. for if we can tie, Hello, Excellent. I think two of those are amazing. Do we have any? should be to predict his Baltimore team.

Thanks over cowhide and cotton seams, no muscle bulk, whiplash arm, a physics baseball bullet, projected using electrophysical energy produced by his brain, neural and bio-semantically tightened and chemically infused with fruit honey and other elements. He threw this ball and it got there before the runner. If only the person was running as fast as Asafa Powell, and I think we need this kind of thing in the city. I think we need his light and not his darkness, not his fatalism. Thank you very much. That exhausts our list of registered speakers. If there's anyone in chambers wishing to speak, please come forward at this time. Provide your name and neighborhood for the record. Hi, my name is Bernadette. Good to meet you. The past week I had to do some heavy duty research of my soul and of what's in front of us And I no longer support Cory O'Connor. I am 100% for Ganey for his bold move and wanting to make inclusionary housing citywide. Back in 1996 my family and I were in the heart of fighting against then Frank Gigliotti and Harry Reed Shaw when they wanted to go back to segregated neighborhoods. Ganey's bill is the only bill that will give these kids hope, Going back to neighborhoods, young families who cannot get into housing because they have a family of children. it's not working And sadly enough, there are people working for Cory that are involved with these pro-housing programs. I was a member of a pro-housing group under YIMBY. I was called a NIMBY. There was a statement that was made when I asked: don't you support people having the right to vote on zoning changes and coding changes? Because that's what this movement is all about. And I was told a person's right to vote on zoning and coding changes should not go beyond their property line. And I was told that's not the right thing to do. And I was told that a person's right to vote on zoning and coding changes should not go beyond their property line. Bullcrap, That spells segregation to me. Thank you, Ed Ganey. There is so much more to what's happening, but I will not, as long as there is a breath in my body, see our community go back to segregated neighborhoods when Washington is trying to take away every kind of— every kind of- inclusionary chance that these kids have. And I'm sorry, Cory, but I'm not going to get into it. I want you to take that pen and paper And I'm not going to get into it. I want you to take that pen and paper, But I want you to take that pen and paper. If you have a chance, just press the button. It is now, It is now. It is now.

My name is BJ Sampson and I live in the 11th Ward, 4th District, Proud to have Kahari Mosley as my council representative, But I stand before you today representing the underprivileged and persons who are without a voice. Why am I standing here? I'm here to talk about the lack of seeing minorities on contracts. As we begin to enter the summer and the springtime, when a lot of construction will be taking place, you'll see on many of the signs that says your tax dollars at work. Well, when I see my tax dollars at work, I expect to see someone who looks like me or my brother or my uncle. I expect to see that, but yet I don't. In each and every last one of the council persons area, there are minorities that exist that need jobs And, with Trump and the various administrations laying off people, you're not gonna have a hard problem finding persons to fill those jobs. I ask that you please, please, consider hiring minorities and people who need to work, who are out of your district and need to have representation, where they can be proud, where their children can look at them as gaining full employment. Please consider your tax dollars at work, a duty that you owe to your citizens and your community. In addition to me being a member of Delta, Sigma, Theta, I'm also a committee woman and I've seen each and every one of you at the endorsement day. I'd like to be able to shake your hands at the next endorsement, saying thank you for following through with making sure minorities are at all of the construction sites. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Good morning. my name is Jafon F Brown. When all these beautiful ladies started walking up here I almost snuck in the bunch with them, But I wanted to come down to explain Now. some of you may know I've been coming down here for years- over 27 years. I've been coming All the years that I've been coming here. when you speak about the Hill District, you also hear how bad it is and how dangerous it is. I remember KDKA. the one man was hollering: yeah, you criminals up here in the Hill, you're going to jail. And that was the time when O'Connor had in his district in Squirrel Hill if a child got into any kind of problem, they had a person that they could contact and they would pay any restitution that needed to be paid. Unlike with black children, you go right to juvenile court or to jail. Now you talk about the Hill District being so bad and so dangerous, but you know something: traveling through the Hill District where I live at. as I was going down Wally Avenue up by the restaurant, up at the top of Wally, we're looking and there's deer, about 20 or 30 laying down, And over across the street there was about five or six more. My grandbabies say: look at the deer. I thought they couldn't lay down because we heard horses can't lay down but they're sick. they can't lay down but they do lay down. But do you understand you? people say how dangerous the Hill is. the wild animals, God's animals, know where to come. They know you ain't coming up there because you know why they ain't coming. I can remember Ms Gross- and I really don't care for her, And it was because of what she said. She said, ah, when they were getting a new police chief, they said they would come to every neighborhood. Well, she stood up and said, ah, me and Bill Perduto decided that all the Hill District would come to Lawrenceville. That means two buses to get there And they only have to take one. When we would come to speak at city council, all we had to do is take one. Why would you make us go to Lawrenceville? But you know something: I'm telling you that I'm gonna keep coming and fighting because you need to hear the people, Just like your president said that beautiful woman. you hear what she said. You need to hear us. I was at a post-sick. I was at a- I'm talking fast but please excuse me, You need to hear this. I was somewhere and I said I had went to Jamaica. Well, there was a Jamaican man. So he's asking me: where did I go? I knew Kingston, but then I said: wait a minute, there's a mountain, real tall mountain, where there had been a Jamaican man and a white woman. They had run away. They had told him: come back, We will not kill you, You can be together. But they jumped off and killed themselves. Now, the Jamaican man didn't know. Thank you, Ms Brown. Okay, I'm sorry.

**Section of meeting transcript:**
Our next order of business is public comment. I would like to remind everyone that the rules of council state that comments are limited to matters of concern, official action or deliberation which may before City Council. Profanity will not be permitted. After you recall, please restate your name, provide your neighborhood for the record. You'll be given three minutes to speak. Our first And actually only registered speaker is Dr Ronald Miller. Dr Ronald Miller, the Mexican War Streets, Teotihuacan, Mexico, University of Pittsburgh, theory of sports inventor and instructor and the Global Intelligence Society candidate for president in 2028 Global Information Intelligence Networknet. Concerns of council include a focus on the child and also baseball, given Mr LaBelle's will of council on Roberto Clemente in February. This is consistent with my initiative four, where I think the child must come first, locally and nationally. The Pirate opener is three days away against the Yankees 1960. the Pirates won against the Yankees Y9, P9. ninth inning- Numbers are not in the game. Number nine: Mazeroski hits a home run in the greatest game in the history of baseball, I think Roberto Clemente. in 1971, after the World Series win, fusing Espanol and English, he said this: If I was president of the United States, I would build a sports city and take in kids from all ways of life. Why not? We in the city and the country need Clemente's intense, non-slop fusion of high info and high Q intelligence. Number 21 Pirates play fused 21 information and intelligence vectors. Roberto Clemente, the thrower, strategically chose the trapezoidal geography of right field more than left field and center field because it maxed outing runners. If you have had to strike out of a five-year argument, I would like you guys to carefully why you're sticking in in training. I think you'll understand that We can tied. for if we can tie, Hello, Excellent. I think two of those are amazing. Do we have any? should be to predict his Baltimore team. I think we should consider or more of a- I'd like you to pay attention instead- Or, if you don't have any, try a little bit longer, even harder, like jedlina Jimenez, I see você Speak up. I see Joseph Cceviewer, You have to put a little Hein Underto. Oh, father And better man, And good night to you, to everybody, Thank you for for yourommeinkle 83. Thanks over cowhide and cotton seams, no muscle bulk, whiplash arm, a physics baseball bullet, projected using electrophysical energy produced by his brain, neural and bio-semantically tightened and chemically infused with fruit honey and other elements. He threw this ball and it got there before the runner. If only the person was running as fast as Asafa Powell, and I think we need this kind of thing in the city. I think we need his light and not his darkness, not his fatalism. Thank you very much. That exhausts our list of registered speakers. If there's anyone in chambers wishing to speak, please come forward at this time. Provide your name and neighborhood for the record. Hi, my name is Bernadette. Good to meet you. The past week I had to do some heavy duty research of my soul and of what's in front of us And I no longer support Cory O'Connor. I am 100% for Ganey for his bold move and wanting to make inclusionary housing citywide. Back in 1996 my family and I were in the heart of fighting against then Frank Gigliotti and Harry Reed Shaw when they wanted to go back to segregated neighborhoods. Ganey's bill is the only bill that will give these kids hope, Going back to neighborhoods, young families who cannot get into housing because they have a family of children. it's not working And sadly enough, there are people working for Cory that are involved with these pro-housing programs. I was a member of a pro-housing group under YIMBY. I was called a NIMBY. There was a statement that was made when I asked: don't you support people having the right to vote on zoning changes and coding changes? Because that's what this movement is all about. And I was told a person's right to vote on zoning and coding changes should not go beyond their property line. And I was told that's not the right thing to do. And I was told that a person's right to vote on zoning and coding changes should not go beyond their property line. Bullcrap, That spells segregation to me. Thank you, Ed Ganey. There is so much more to what's happening, but I will not, as long as there is a breath in my body, see our community go back to segregated neighborhoods when Washington is trying to take away every kind of— every kind of- inclusionary chance that these kids have. And I'm sorry, Cory, but I'm not going to get into it. I want you to take that pen and paper And I'm not going to get into it. I want you to take that pen and paper, But I want you to take that pen and paper. If you have a chance, just press the button. It is now, It is now. It is now.
