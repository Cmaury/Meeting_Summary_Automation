Anybody who knew Timmy Lenardi, who's Rico's father, late Timmy Lenardi, he's like the godfather of Beachview, this guy, And he made the best food And to this day, I will say I think I liked his pizza just a little bit better than Rico's, Sorry. Okay, that's Sherry. Sherry doesn't make pizza, Okay? whereas Slice on Broadway has proudly served the Pittsburgh community for over 15 years, delivering quality, consistency and passion in every slice at all six of their locations.

Vic You, Tommy, Come on, Tommy, Come on, just stand up here with them and look good, would you? You want the whole team right? They're all part of the team. Yes, While they're coming up here, Oh, oh, our acting chief Devine is here. All right, Marty, I'm glad you're here, buddy. So you know, I'm longtime friends with Shawn and Sherry now, but Shawn and I grew up in the Beachview neighborhood eating Slice pizza. Well, it wasn't Slice then, but you know it was more Fiori's and Vito's then, I guess. But you know, Shawn, many, many years ago- it's been how many years now, Sherry, since you started Fifty? Oh yeah, since 2007. Yeah, we were on the golf course and Shawn was telling me about your ambitions and I was like, yeah, that's great, That's great. Yeah, that's great, right. Yeah, his wife's going in the construction business, Sure, right. You know I was a pessimist. I guess you would say, but boy, have you proven me wrong and everybody else wrong. So I'll go about the proclamation. Whereas the City of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania region take great pride in honoring individuals whose hard work, resilience and commitment to the community are the most important and big, clean, subconscious movements in program management, they don't need any added spice if they don't have a mantra: marketing education operations to protect their community from judgements or helping others culminate their friendships. sprinkling a small grudge, growing wealth overnight. and another reason to hold aulate your environmentalatu breakfast wants is that the wealth positive on television channels is never given to workers and local hotels. settling your business with theengl From page it goes Money. add peoouch orankind diversity and equity Vocers with the ssrz to fashion belliger 300 teachers 50 plus comparable 05, The, A small business on television on Monday, the AUvY. we have a stage Hee raj to engagement. And whereas raised in the Mount Washington neighborhood of the city of Pittsburgh, hard-working blue-collar family, Sherry learned the values of determination and integrity from a young age. She became one of the first in her family to graduate college, earning a business degree from Duquesne University. Whereas Sherry utilized her federal contracting and construction management expertise to build her own business, SB Thomas, from the ground up, growing from a one-woman operation into a thriving construction management firm with a local, national and international footprint. Whereas Sherry utilized her federal contracting and construction management expertise to build her own business, SB Thomas- I read that. sorry about that. Whereas Thomas is a woman-owned and woman-led advisory construction management firm based in southwestern Pennsylvania That has delivered projects across multiple sectors, including higher education, K through 12, schools and health facilities, multi-family housing and heavy highway. Whereas, beyond her professional accomplishments, Sherry is a tireless advocate for women and girls in construction, serving as president of the Pittsburgh's chapter of National Association of Women in Construction. Now you may- she may look familiar to you because she's here every year and Councilwoman Gross usually, you know, does the proclamation. for that reason, And I love what you do- bringing construction into young females and teaching them the trade That is. there's so much opportunity there, as you as you know So. so I think that's one of the most special things you do. Whereas, beyond her- I read that note now there- for be resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby commend Sherry Thomas as she embodies the spirit of Pittsburgh: leading with vision, monitoring with purpose and building a legacy of excellence that uplifts her community and inspires future generations. Be it further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby declare Sunday, May 6th 2025 to be Sherry Thomas in the City of Pittsburgh Day May. we have a motion to approve. I move, I move, All right. All right, Sherry, can you get that in the way? I just want to say: look. as Sherry's husband and business partner, I have had a front row seat to this amazing small business story. And yesterday, you know, when we were in DC and Sherry went across that stage, I was like I'm going to be the first person to get a seat to this award. And I was in the front row again, right there, literally in the front row. And to see someone that you love so much, that's worked so hard for so long, be recognized in such an amazing way And, you know, to be recognized again here today, I really just can't even put into words how proud it makes me feel, Other than to say, Sherry, I love you, I'm proud of you, And there's no one else more deserving of this award than you. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Sherry, Thank you, Thank you, Sherry, Thank you, Sherry, Thank you, Sherry, Thank you, Sherry, Thank you. So thank you to City Council, and especially Councilman Coghill, for putting this proclamation forth and recognizing our team at SB Thomas during National Small Business Week. I am deeply honored to stand before you as the recipient of the Pennsylvania Small Business Person of the Year Award. Thank you, Sherry, Thank you. As Shawn mentioned, I accepted the award in Washington DC, but being recognized back home in Pittsburgh, where I was born and where SB Thomas was born, is just so much better. This is also a time to be grateful for those who helped make this award possible. We have members of the SB Thomas team here today to share the celebration, because this recognition is not just a personal achievement but a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team, because without them, this is not possible. I always say that we have the best team in the region and I would put us up against anyone, big or small, and this award is an affirmation that we have the best team in the state. Thank you to the SB Thomas team, To our clients like the City of Pittsburgh. SB Thomas is a small business that has accomplished big things. In the beginning, you took a chance on a small, unknown business and we could not let you down. Your programs and support for women-owned businesses gave us the chance to compete for your work and we are thankful that you have chosen us To our friends that came out to support us today. The SB Thomas team has been a lifelong friend of Sean's and grew up together. They have been lifelong friends of Sean. They grew up together and that is what the Pittsburgh spirit is all about. These guys have known each other for years and it is amazing and we truly appreciate the support you have given us today To my family. just like SB Thomas, I was born and raised in Pittsburgh by hardworking parents. My father was a steel worker and my mom worked for US Air. My mom is here today. This award is a real honor. It is an honor. It is an honor result of all of her support and sacrifices that she made so that I could follow my dreams, even though I didn't know what they were sometimes. Thank you, Mom, To my husband and partner in this journey, as we work to grow this business, you have seen me at my best and at my worst. You always remind me that I can't be in the fight and manage the battle at the same time. And as I walked across that stage and accepted that award in DC, I just want you to know that I could not have done it without you there with me. Thank you for all of your love and support. So, starting a business is hard. Growing a business is hard. Sustaining a business is even harder. It's a risk. We put up our own money. We used our house as collateral. We high-five when we make payroll, But in the end it's worth it. Thank you again to City Council, Councilman Coghill, for recognizing SV Thomas, your homegrown. Thank you, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Small Business of 2025. Good to see you, Good to see you. What a wonderful job, Wonderful job, Wonderful job, Wonderful job, Wonderful job, Wonderful job. There we go, There we go. We left aota like noob. Yes, That would be a nice way to give a hand. Yeah, Great job, All right, All right, Fantastic Cheers. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Thank you all so much. I'm not going to take time to talk. We actually have two youth speakers who would love to tell you a little bit more about this process, about the Youth Steering Committee, and also invite you all to come out May 17th and May 31st to join us for the garden install and the ribbon cutting. Thank you all so much and we'll invite Miles. Hello everybody, My name is Miles Owens. I'm with Humane Action Pittsburgh's Youth Steering Committee. Thank you so much for recognizing me. You're welcome, Thank you. So before I start recognizing us, City Council, I first want to start off by saying why this is so important, and it's not just because of the pollinators, It's because it shows that a youth-led project can succeed. in this city- and you know all our life as youth- it's common to hear, oh, you're too young, You can't make a change. but I think this proves that that's just not true anymore and it's awesome to be able to do something like this and be recognized. so thank you. I also want to talk about my personal experience with the Youth Steering Committee. Something that I remember pretty distinctly is we brought in Dwayne Walker, the mayor of Aliquippa, and he just taught us how to be excellent leaders and be pillars in our community, and that's something that stuck with me and that's just a skill that I gained from the Youth Steering Committee that I wouldn't have gained elsewhere. But yeah, I think I'm gonna let Ella speak a bit, but thank you guys so much for recognizing us. It's a pleasure. We're proud of what we've done. I would just like to thank everybody again for coming here today and also invite you once more to come join us for the ribbon-cutting on May 31st. This is just a really big opportunity for us, like as students. it's insane to see like people here gathered and families coming for support and also that we actually made something physical that you can look at. You know, pollination, as was mentioned in the whereas statements, isn't just about, like, the flowers and the bees and stuff. It's really just about the community and the whole of society, and so it's really awesome to see change being made and it informs us that like things can change and you can do something about the environment that you were born into and where you are as a person. Thank you, Do you want to come up members? Yes, yes, Questions: Okay, One more? Yes, Thank you, Let's see. There's a couple more. So thank you guys again, Thanks, Thank you, ladies, And just to bring to light for those that we've seen that you're joining: Thank you so much for coming out of Was giving me an amazing. yeah, I mean my studying. I was kind of tired of doing this, and then I had a project to have so much to say that I wanted to come and and to create like a YWCA or something that I have been doing recently. LEADER, being a part of here to reach people does really push us in a direction towards a20 very much. So let me ask you something: How do we- all of you who are- come to the networking you're able to have a coming out? Yeah, Everybody. And we have one to be read into the record from Councilman Mosley.

Is Edward Wren with us? If not, our next speaker is John Rhodes. Hi, My name is John Rhodes and I live in Polish Hill. I serve as a board member of affordable housing, nonprofit city of bridges community land trust and I'm a member of the housing justice table. I'm in support of reforming minimum lot size. I'm in support of it because I want our city and my neighborhood to be a more affordable and sustainable place for people. But right now, Pittsburgh is facing a crisis on all those fronts And my neighborhood of Polish Hill is experiencing that firsthand. According to the US census, from 2019 to 2022, median rent in Polish Hill increased by nearly 50%. From 2012 to 2022, the median sale price quadrupled. Meanwhile, the housing supply has plummeted. In those same 11 years, the neighborhood lost over 10% of its housing units, with rental units decreasing at twice the rate as owner-owned properties, And the housing supply has plummeted. And the housing supply has plummeted And rental units decreasing at twice the rate as owner-occupied homes. Thus, with rising housing costs and fewer homes, there is rampant displacement. Our population decreased by 11% and black residents were the most affected, with a decrease of 48%. The evidence is clear: Under the current zoning, Polish Hill has become the smallest, most expensive, least diverse place it has ever been. I am in favor of removing barriers to building more housing because, as all the evidence shows, the more homes there are, the lower housing costs get, And, according to Pittsburgh's own housing needs assessment of 2022, vacancy across multifamily developments is at less than 5%, the lowest rate in the city since 1980. In the first quarter of 2025, according to RealPage Market Analytics, Pittsburgh had the third largest annual effective rate change in rent. We need more homes and we need more apartments for medium and low-income families the most. About half the land in Polish Hill sits on residential-based zoning districts that would benefit from this bill by allowing the neighborhood to return to the denser, more affordable place that it used to be. Because statistics can be impersonal and abstract, I thought it would also be helpful to give real-world examples demonstrating how dire the issue is. in my neighborhood, At 316 Harmer Street, there used to be a six-unit apartment building which accepted housing choice vouchers. At 3209 Dobson, there used to be two buildings that housed a total of seven apartments and a storefront. That's all been replaced by demolition. We now have just four townhouses, each with built-in garage. Even more to the point are examples like 3128 Dobson and 3205 Brereton. At each address, there used to stand a two-unit apartment building. What's taken their places? Concrete parking pads Where the neighborhood used to have 17 apartments and a storefront. we'll now have less than a quarter of the housing we used to, replacing it with concrete slabs and million-dollar townhomes. And these are just a few examples of many. throughout Polish Hill. My neighborhood is on the fast track to becoming exorbitantly expensive and entirely global. I'm not a car-dependent. Please support minimum lot size reform which, in one small way, can help. However, just as you can't build a house with only a hammer, in order to create real change for affordability, inclusivity and a transit-friendly city, this bill must be accompanied by many other reforms, such as responsible funding programs, expanded inclusionary zoning and additional density proposals such as equitable, transit-oriented development. We need champions on council who are willing to stand up at community meetings and here at council to make the case for these changes, or we'll just be a neighborhood and a city that's slowly but surely displaces our most vulnerable neighbors. Thank you, And our last registered speaker is Morgan Shaw. Good morning, Can you all hear me? Yes, we can. Thank you. Hi everyone. My name is Morgan Shaw. I live in Shadyside, at 260 Shady Avenue. I'm in Councilwoman Strasburg's district. I am speaking here today in favor of Councilman Bobby Wilson's bill- Forgive me, I always forget the number 1579- to reduce minimum lot sizes throughout the city of Pittsburgh in the districts that are included in the bill. I spoke a few weeks ago at the hearing. Several of you were there and I don't know if you remember, but I said at that time I was hoping that this would come up soon enough, because I'm moving in a couple weeks And I don't know if you did it because of me- Probably not. But either way, I want to say I'm very thankful that this bill has come before council so quickly. This issue is not something that the city of Pittsburgh should wait on. every day that we wait, every month that we wait, Housing gets more expensive and more of our neighbors get displaced. Not everyone has the choice of when they want to move And a lot of the reason for that is because housing has gotten too expensive for them and they're forced to move. So what we've been unable to do to match the demand for the amount of people that want to live in Pittsburgh because of all the jobs it has, the access to transit, the access to walkable amenities, shops, schools, all of those things. We basically prevented ourselves from building enough housing to meet that demand And now people are getting forced out. I really care about this bill- the minimum lot size bill- because it is a direct result of segregation. It was designed explicitly And it's a direct result of the fact that we need to segregate neighborhoods based on income and therefore segregate them based on race. So, please, I urge you to pass this bill. And again, I really want to thank Councilman Bobby Wilson and Councilwoman Bob Warwick and Councilman Bob Charlin for getting this bill through. You know, if you can get parking requirements done in the next week, that would be great too, But I don't think that's going to happen. But I hope that that comes up next And I hope that we can continue to be living, leaving the city in a better place and with more liberalized zoning. Thank you so much. Thank you. That exhausts a list of registered speakers. If there's anyone in chambers wishing to speak, please come forward at this time, Provide your name and neighborhood for the record. You'll also be given three minutes to speak. Good morning. My name is Vaughn F Brown. I live at 715 Mercer Street, That's up in the Hill District. First, I want to show that I have a money order for 120 for WESA, the radio station FM, that they said that Trump is trying to alleviate us having any possibility of learning What's happening in our community and possibly even stopping it. So I don't want to talk about Trump- Not today- But I want to say this That I was walking down East Ohio Street yesterday and I came to like 18th Street. I remember crossing the street and as I'm looking down I see pennies. Well, I have a thing about pennies. I pick them up. It depends on what's around, But anyway, I went to pick up pennies and I look up in the doorway: is change. There's a whole handful of change Cup full. I forgot the cup is here, So I picked it up. And so that means that that's a homeless person. And the reason why I say that is that I want to apologize to all the homeless people. There's a young man that caught me walking home from city council and he's saying: Miss Yvonne, Miss Yvonne. And I'm saying: baby, how do I know you? He said, oh, you give me money Sometimes he's homeless. But he started telling me that on the south side there's an Asian cop that is beating up the homeless people. He said they were in the doorway. He came, he beat him, He took the computer, He took the laptop. I am upset And I'm sorry that I hadn't told you this before, because I promised him, I asked him to come. They don't want to come in front of you Because I tell them: come so they can see that you're actually a human being that need help. I am really upset and I'm worried about the man. I had the cup. It's a silver cup. I showed the sergeant of arms because he was saying he has a cup like that. It's full of change. I got all this money. If he comes here to city council, I will give him cash money. I give him at least five dollars. It's about that much. I wish I could show you all of it now. I have it. I have it. I'm not sure if he gave it to the man. I want it, But I have. I need to talk to you, titties, because you are mute. I have to be quiet. My guests changes. You want me to calm down a little bit? Och, Somebody be quiet. I love microwave. I love it. They can't hear me. Sorry, I have to be quiet. I just wanna give you people some battle words. Don't know what else, I don't care. work. whoever the homeless person was his cup and his money, he wouldn't have left it. he wouldn't have left if he hadn't been forced to thank you. please help the homeless. next speaker, please. hi, i'm bernadette from beachview. there's so much stuff i need to bring up to your attention. when i brought the landslide that turned out to be mine subsidence at the fallowfield bridge and they did that big repair on that section of fallowfield, i had told the guys working there that i had done a title search. i had a ghost in my apartment on fallowfield so i did a title search all the way back to the beginning and it was a cool. there was a cool company and then a farm, or vice versa, with all that explains all the grapevines. but anyway, on that same hillside that i know was a coal company, at the corner of hampshire and methel, we have something going on. there is a hole next to the sewer, like the thing where the clown lives down, and a hole big enough for two of me to fall into. there's a fence behind around that property and this is the new building. i think it's the new building and this is the new building. and a little bit down in the middle of the street and then the other side of the building is the net building and there's a dog. it's right across from the brand new remodeled church, the that me. i don't know who to contact for this, and now that the spring is here, all the filled potholes are like muffins that just went pop, pop, pop.

seeing none. the bill is not ready for final action. all in favor of the passage of the bill. while ira name is called. those opposed will vote no report. please take the role, mr charland, mr coghill, aye, ms gross. mr christ, i forgot to like raise my hand to make a comment. can i do that now? i appreciate it. i appreciate it. so i just want to make sure that you know. we are just to remind the public that we just read 1579, which is the bill on minimum lot size, which we heard public comment about a short while ago, and i'm glad that my council members heard testimony about this. so i just wanted to give a brief reflection on this, and i wanted to know, you know, because i'm really tired of hearing the testimony from one of the neighborhoods i represent, polish hill- because it was a really good illustration of the way change happens. it isn't always a, you know, a large building of affordable apartments that comes down, like in pen plaza, which we all saw happen and we all experienced in the media, and it was very visible in less dramatic and less visible ways, but it still happens, right. And so the counts of affordable apartments that we heard that have been lost, some to parking spaces, some to single-family homes, is magnified tenfold, a hundredfold, across the city and across the years. And so it's really important that council not only has been discussing again with the leadership of our current president, Daniel Lavelle, how to create affordability- and not just affordable housing, I'll say, but I think we should call it affordability for the last ten years- But it's clear that we haven't done everything or thought of everything we can do. And so we continue to, to discuss new ideas, discuss deepening some policies we've already put in place, And for that reason I thought that this bill specifically- I'm going to put my magnifiers back on- 1579- should have stayed in standing committee last week, which is why I voted no, which I said on the record last week. And, Madam Clerk, could you bring my comments from last week forward to the record? Yes, Thank you. Thank you That this bill in isolation will not have the impact that it would have had as part of the larger package. I have no, as, again, I'm fully supportive of the words on the page of the language of the bill. And again, a shout out to Councilwoman Warwick and her staff for putting together the legislative text here and pushing forward the policies as part of the larger affordability package. But I encourage Council to take up all of the other reforms, including expanding inclusionary zoning, including parking reforms, including even accessory dwelling units, so that we can talk about how to increase affordability coherently. So, again, while I'm supportive of this language and I thought it should have stayed in standing committee, which is why my provisional, my provisional vote was no- I will vote yes today, But we'll- I think we- those of us who are less comfortable, who either abstained or voted no last week- we'll all be encouraging our colleagues to engage in the conversation of how to increase affordability across all Pittsburgh neighborhoods. So with that, I'll vote yes on the bills. Thank you, Thank you. Thank you very much, Councilman. Thank you, Mr President, I was wanted to refer to Bill 1753. I can't remember. did we? I know we started to vote on it, but I don't know if we actually went through with the. We've read it. We haven't. Okay, we haven't voted on it yet. Okay, Well, you voted yes, I voted on it, Okay, okay. Well, I guess I wanted to see if there was any communication. last week in standing committee I asked about the appraisal of it. It was, I want to say, 600 bucks or so, And I didn't know if we received back communication. I haven't had time to look at that, but from I think it was Kevin at the table, Not that I'm aware of Nothing, nothing aware of. So so, as it stands today, we're probably responsible for the 600 bucks. Okay, Can I switch my vote to that Again? Okay, So you're an aye on all bills, a no on 1753. I am a no on 1753, right, Okay, Thank you. Unless we had, you know, I don't. I'm not aware of any communication. We didn't get communication. then I'm to assume we paying for it. Thanks, Thank you. I believe we're with Councilman Gross, Okay, Thank you. Okay, So we'll continue with Councilman Mosley, Aye, Councilman Smith, Aye, Aye, Mrs Warwick, My March Simpson grumble for 1579 because I wanted it with the inclusionary zoning. but aye, Mr Wilson, This is a little unorthodox here. Can I make a comment? Okay, I promise I'll be brief. Yeah, I just wanted to. since other members sort of discuss a little bit of the bill, I just want to recognize that you know this. this bill- it was part of a package- came over to us and there's a lot going on with that, so much so that you know, I I believe the the, the tone of the discussion in terms of that we would just make developers do affordable, do inclusionary zoning without it being funded is is, you know, my, my hunch in this whole thing is that that is not the case in the public. It is being misled to think that this is a campaign to hold developers accountable and force them to do something that they don't want to do. Developers just want to build And you know this is a scenario where we have, we have what's going on, We have some order, Can't even know. You're currently have the floor council, Okay, so I'll try to wrap this up. So there was a 12 hour meeting at city planning and you know there was no mention of of how this is actually going to take place. It was just a, you know, a way to tell the public that we're going to force developers do this, And you know that's how strong we are. And I'm curious, I know how that plays out. I think that that's not actually what's going to happen And I think the public needs to know that, because of the public is going to end up paying for affordable housing, which we do currently on a lot of different levels. I think that could be a good thing, but the public, you know, should know that, And we should be able to have that discussion, especially in a time of decreasing revenues. and also, something that was quite alarming to me was the amount of wage tax that is being decreased this year, which means that jobs are actually going. people are working outside the city. That could be the trend moving forward. So we need to continually monitor the situation, but this bill provides- you know, this bill decreases- the cost of housing without costing the city anything. And if this bill truly was going to be a part of this package to offer 20 units or more, like to be a part of this? 20 unit or more? Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Maybe that should have just been the part of the bill that maybe that should have just been a part of the zoning code that was changed because this bill- there's so much more for the lots that are between housing that you know either we tore down or you know. you know the city tore down 20 years ago and it's just still vacant or there's just remaining- make a lots that could have single family homes, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, and that all doesn't have anything to do with the proposed inclusionary zoning. So this is a moment where you know we can look like we're getting something done for Pittsburgh without costing the taxpayers anything to make neighborhoods look uniform. And you know, quite frankly, this is a bill that makes us look like we're just not bureaucrats that can't get anything done. So I appreciate everyone who wrote the bill. I appreciate Councilperson Warwick and everything you did, you know, to get this to the city planning, And I'm appreciative of everyone that's been supportive of the process since then. So, looking forward to voting aye, which I will vote now, aye. Thank you, Mr President. Thank you, Mr Lavelle. President Aye, for all the reasons Councilman Gross stated. On Bill 1579: eight ayes zero, noes. On Bill 1753: seven ayes one: no. The bills have received the required number of votes. It is passed. finally And finally, Councilman Kari Mosley, presenting the Committee of Integral Intergovernmental Educational Affairs. Thank you, Mr President. Councilman Mosley presents Bill number 1796. Reporter to Committee on Intergovernmental and Educational Affairs for April 30th 2025, with an affirmative recommendation. Bill 1747 Resolution- Resolution. Resolution adopting plan revision to the City of Pittsburgh's official sewage facilities plan for 7415 Hermitage Street, at no cost to the city. You've heard the reading and it's out of the bills. Is there any discussion? Seeing none. the bill is not ready for final action. All in favor of the passage of the bill. vote aye. when the name is called. Those opposed will vote no. Will the clerk please take the roll? Mr Sharland Aye. Mr Coghill Aye. Ms Gross Aye. Mr Mosley Aye. Ms Kale. Aye. Ms Kale-Smith. Aye. Ms Warwick Aye. Mr Wilson Aye. Mr LeVell-President Aye, Eight ayes zero, noes. The bill having received a legally required number of votes, is passed. finally, That takes us to motions and resolutions, And I'll begin with Councilman Warwick. Yes, thank you. I would like to call for a post agenda on Duquesne Light Company's response to the Duquesne Light Company's response to the construction of the New York City City Hall. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Mr President, I apologize. This upheld my response to the recent severe weather event. You know I still have people in my district without power. I'm not I'm I'm not sure about others, But you know I have folks who have now been eight days without power And, while I am extremely appreciative of Emiley and Luis at Duquesne Light, of all the workers have come out, you know, working on the, on the light boxes. you know everybody on the ground in the middle of the emergency, as well as our city workers, our ems, our dpw right, everybody kind of on the ground together working through the emergency as it is currently ongoing. you know, i think everyone is doing a great job in in in terms of that. however, the overall issue of duquesne light company being apparently completely unable to respond in a timely manner to, you know, a 10-minute weather event- granted, that was severe, but you know, leaving folks without power for eight days in 2025 is simply unacceptable. people are very upset. i, i sympathize with them and i think that it, you know, i think that folks in pittsburgh certainly should be looking long, you know, looking very closely at what it means to have privatized utilities that more or less, we have no control over, but at any rate, so that's why i do want to talk about the issue of the dpw and the dpw's and the other issues that we have to address in the city of new york. i, i, i, i really, i really want to call this but, but i, but i don't want this post agenda to just be, you know, us sort of piling on to duquesne light. so i, i, my, my hope is that we can have at the table duquesne light representatives from the puc and also representatives from our various, from our state and federal offices, so that we can also talk about what it would take for this to ensure that something like this does not happen again. And that is obviously gonna be a state, federal and also Duquesne Light PUC. that is gonna be a collaboration, to be sure. So I would like to get everyone to the table to have a kind of post-mortem, so to speak, about this severe weather event. Thank you, May I get a second and then we'll go into discussion Second. Thank you. So I've got Councilwoman Smith, Councilman Coghill, then Councilman Wilson, then Councilman Mulvey. I wanna thank Councilwoman Warwick for calling for the post-agenda, And I do know that the state reps are also calling for some things because they're experiencing so much, And I actually got calls from Forest Hills yesterday, which I never do, but they're just. everybody across the county is just so frustrated. But I do think it has to be beyond just Duquesne Light. Duquesne Light is an issue for sure, And I'd like to know how many people they have on that. they had to call in 400 people to help us. I think that that's significant And I think that's leading to all the other issues. But I also think that we need to know what the plan is, And so I hope that we include public safety in this and others, because you know OCHS, everybody should be involved in this. I received calls from seniors and high rises in Brookline, which I just now represent, which I didn't even realize. It just happened in January that I got this portion of Brookline, And thanks to Councilman Charlton's office for sending the call my way. But I do want to thank the public safety director for addressing the issues there. They were getting no food, They had no electricity, There was all kinds of things that they were out of, And just the seniors were just totally terrified not knowing what was going on for so long. They felt so forgotten. So I want to thank the public safety director for that. But I do think that back years ago when Snowmageddon occurred, then Luke Ravenstall, a 27-year-old mayor, went away for his birthday and got slammed by a lot of people- as you recall- councilman or council president- that he got slammed for not having a plan in place And back then Councilwoman Rudiak took a lot of time to make sure that, after slamming them, that we put a plan in place. So I hope that the result of this is that we have a plan in place, because when 911 goes down, what is the backup plan for the county? And that's what happened initially. We had a lot of people who were working from home. We had people who were working from home, who were working from home that had no power, And that was a challenge, And I do think that that's okay to let people work from home, but we should have an alternative: to be able to come in so that we could man and volunteer for 311 ourselves. I did that during Snowmageddon. I try never to criticize during the crisis. I try to help through as much as I can. And then I think that the other thing that I think that we should be doing is we should be doing what we can to help people, And that's what I think is important, And I think that's what I think is important, And I think that's what I think is important, And then make sure that we're doing whatever we can do on our level. But I do think that there's also a lot of concern for me. when the food bank also lost their power, there was issues of how they were gonna get food out to the public. So to me, immediately we should have been able to tap into, instead of having to raise funds, we should be able to tap into the Food Justice Fund, And I think there's 3 million there. So there's a lot of concerns for me with the partnership with Allegheny County and what happens when 911 unfortunately went down. What's our backup plan if that happens again. What's our backup plan for food and getting food out to the people if the food bank goes down, And what the PUC is doing in terms of the utilities, Because I think that that's a conversation that we have to have about all of our utilities, not just Duquesne Light. But I do wanna thank the linemen and the crews that went out. I do wanna thank the DPW crews. We've had many issues where they also were putting themselves in jeopardy and in danger. So I do wanna thank the people who responded. I do wanna thank our crews, our workers, for all that they've done. I do wanna thank the public safety director for responding to a lot of calls, I imagine from all of us. But I do wanna know what our plan is going forward. So I hope that from this post agenda, we draft a plan for any emergency, not just this type of emergency, Because this was a storm, This wasn't even a hurricane, This was a storm. So if we're this broken after a week and a half of a storm, what are we gonna do if this is something more significant, like a snowmageddon? So, thank you. Thank you, Councilman Karku. Thank you, Mr President. So, yeah, I wanna echo Councilwoman Kilsmith's comments. First and foremost, I am also happy we're having a post agenda on this, But I do wanna say that this was unlike any storm we've seen. Many of us who are old enough probably remember the tornadoes that ripped through Mount Washington. Oh gosh, that would be 25 years ago or so. Yeah, But that was more confined. I'm a little older than 25. Yeah, that was confined to three or four neighborhoods. This was catastrophic. And I really wanna give a shout out to Emily who used to work on this floor. I think she worked for Councilwoman Strasburger, I can't remember, But she took every one of my calls. I couldn't believe it. I could just feel the frustration And almost I could sympathize with her that day, let me tell you. But she took every phone call for me, managed to get things done. I mean, I couldn't believe the devastation. There were areas, and one thing I wanna go over in the post agenda is I was worried. There were so many areas I had cut off where you just couldn't get in or out with a vehicle. So I was worried, like somebody had a cardiac arrest. What is our plan? Do we have a plan? I called Director Schmidt and he assured me that, yes, we have the know how We would get the job done if we had to get in and take somebody out. But I worry about that on a more bigger scale. as it was, And I will say, just this morning I got calls, people still with their power out. There's linesmen from Alabama there. So this was just like any other natural disaster in the United States. pretty much We had to call Duquesne Light. I don't know if they were under resourced or not, I can't, I'm not in a position to say that- But I do know they called in people from Erie and Cleveland and Alabama and everywhere to come in and try to get these, our electric back on and the power line, And they were able to get the power lines off the grounds which were very dangerous. So I just really look forward to a post agenda. But I really truly wanted to say thank you to Emily, the representative for Duquesne Light now. She did a fantastic job. So that's it. Thanks, Mr President. Thank you, Councilman Wilson. Yeah, I just want to say that there is, there's been a obviously a good response, Just in general. I mean, you see people out there working every day power's being turned back on. So I'm looking forward to a post agenda just to really get a sense of what's what happens in a scenario like this, Because we're not in the side of managing the city And it's in the all, everything, all the workers, that are being allocated to cut down trees and all that. So I'm definitely interested in that And how Duquesne Light, how they prioritize different neighborhoods, Because I know that I had a neighborhood recently that did question where they were in the priority list And luckily that luckily they like that scenario was resolved And they were actually get their power on two days sooner. They just got the power back on Sunday So, but they were scheduled for Tuesday to at least get it on by Tuesday. So hopefully You know people that are still dealing with that, hopefully they are ahead of schedule on what they're predicting out there. So wish the best everyone, And I want to thank Duquesne Light for all the efforts that they've done so far. Thanks, Thank you, Councilor Mosley. Thank you. Yeah, I want to echo all my colleagues' comments about the extreme weather event We experienced, like my comments, you know, last week. I think you know we should be, you know very intentional and deliberate. you know how we talk about These extreme weather events. you know clearly. you know Duquesne Light had never experienced. you know over a quarter million people. you know out of power. you know simultaneously. you know throughout their network. I think at one point it was up to like 350,000 people, you know, without power, which you know, you know really emphasizes you know, why we need to have a post agenda and why we need to be looking at having plans to respond. You know, I think that's a really important point. You know, I think that's a really important point. You know, I think that's a really important point. You know, I think that's a really important point. You know, to these weather events- and maybe, you know, a potential silver lining could be being that Duquesne Light never experienced, or any of us ever experienced, you know, this kind of weather event. Maybe this can be instructive. you know, to have a plan, because I don't know if you can put a plan together for something you've never experienced before. So possibly this can provide us, you know, with some instruction on how to respond to these kind of weather events, which I believe will only increase. you know, as the impact of climate change increases in this region And we have, you know, more wet weather events here in this region than we experienced in the past. I know they said it was the third highest velocity winds that they've ever recorded at Pittsburgh Airport. You know. so this was definitely one of the most extreme weather events you know, we've experienced, you know. So it really is a really important thing And it really to me, you know, emphasizes the importance of understanding the new reality and the new normal when it comes to weather in this region- And we will begin to experience more of these weather events- and understanding that the trees that have grown in this part of the country for hundreds of years cannot withstand 80-mile power winds, like the palm trees in Florida. So it puts us at a great disadvantage, you know, as these weather events, And I think that's something that we need to be able to do. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Just one last question. I know that the city's weather is going to increase, So I look forward to that conversation, look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and anyone else who is interested in figuring out how we can make our city more resilient, moving forward as these weather events increase. But I do want to thank the folks from Department of Public Works, Forestry, Duquesne Light, Public Safety. You know I was out on Joshua Street and Lincoln-Lemington late Friday night with Duquesne Light fire and police Majority is addressing a live wire and i know there was live wires, you know, all over the county that had to be addressed first and i know there's folks i'm still checking in with this morning to see if they have power and you know, for the record, i don't have power yet. so hopefully, you know, duke ain't like gets the power back on at my house, but i've been focused on getting everybody else's power on and hopefully my wife will let me in the house because i've been so focused on getting everybody else's power back on or helping working with duquesne light that you know my power has been on the back end. but being that today is the deadline, let's hope that duquesne light meets the deadline and gets the power back on in north point breeze as well. but i thank everyone for their comments and look forward to working with folks you know on this very important issue moving forward. thank you, councilman gross. thank you. i also want to thank councilman warwick for motioning for the post agenda and i appreciated councilman smith's and i appreciate it. councilman smith's and i appreciate it. councilman smith's comments about the lack of backup power at some critical comments about the lack of backup power at some critical services like the food bank, like 9-1-1 and i. i would ask the post agenda sponsor if there's some way to integrate. summary evaluation of the communication systems that we have that maybe did not used to be dependent on electrical power, specifically digital communications- right used to be wired landlines, right. so if those of us who are old enough to remember a lot of times when your power was out, your telephone still worked, and now digital communications- spencerly, voiceover protocols that we have now, if you're you know, your cell phone might still have a charge, but if your computer is down, and that is what is running your communications and then you don't have communications. so just one extra element: that, if we're creating resilience plans and emergency response plans, is something that i don't know enough about and i'd be eager to learn more about. i appreciate it, thank you. thank you before going to no, okay. so, councilwoman warwick, if you're okay, because you did acknowledge that we're still in this emergency, i would just hope that we could work to maybe schedule this out for like four or five weeks. oh, yeah, yeah, okay, and it's going to take some time, i think, to figure out who who all needs to be at the table and all that. so, yeah, no, no, this is yeah good, thank you. and to councilman mosley's point about ever increasing climate change in our region, i think it'd probably be helpful. i'm not sure what they contribute to this immediate conversation, but if we had our director of city planning there, because we are going through a comp plan, right, so as we're doing a comprehensive plan, this should be a part of that conversation, so we would. i think it'd be helpful to just invite them as well. yeah, and as, as we set this up, i'll make sure to connect with everyone and make sure that all the folks that members want to be at the table are at the table. you know, okay, yeah, thank you. all those in favor say aye, aye, all right, we'll work with the councilman warwick in the clerk's office to get that scheduled. anything else from members? councilman moseley? on a lighter note, i wanted to kindred graduate all the 40, some thousand participants in the marathon that this past sunday. that included myself running in the half marathon and you know as good as it was. i was able to cross the finish line. my legs are now punishing me, you know, for that, but you know the folks at the marathon were great. dpw was amazing. public safety was amazing. it wasn't just city police. i saw county law enforcement as well as state law enforcement out and you know, did the fact that it was star wars day added to the fun. i had my r2d2 outfit on, which was was a crowd favorite. definitely, you know, helped get me through bloomfield in the strip district as my legs were starting to give out. but, yeah, it was a great day and, you know, definitely, whether you do the relay, the 5k, the one miler or the fitness test, it's just a great day in in the city of pittsburgh. so i was proud to participate, want to give a shout out to all the folks, the thousands, probably thousands of folks throughout the city to help, you know, make it, including, you know, the onlookers and the spectators that spent hours out. you know, just to, you know, give us that boost that we need to make it a great day. thank you so much for joining us. thank you for having me. thank you for having me, thank you for having me. thank you for having me. thank you for having me. thank you for having me. thank you for having me, thank you for having me when we're at mile 10, mile 11 or, if you're doing the full mile 22, mile 23. so it was a great day in the city of pittsburgh. in light of, obviously, the challenges you know that we're facing as a region in light of the storm, but i was, you know, silver lining on what's been a tough week in the city. thank you and congratulations, councilman wilson. then i just want to say thanks for those comments, councilman mosley, and it's it's good to hear that the fourth was was with you and we're excited about that. thank you, councilman smith. thank you, just real briefly. i just want to talk a little bit about what happened at your, your field, councilman colg hill. we had kids from elliott, westwood and brookline all playing on a field yesterday when an adult father got in a fight with a 15 year old kid, beat the kid up and then fired a shot at him, and this is the second time we've had such an incident on a baseball field within the year- and so i'm just going to say that i think we need to talk about what we're doing to keep our kids and our families safe on those fields, on all the fields. this particular place has, i believe, a rec center. i think it would be great to have the rec centers open, you know later. so there's adults in the area, but it's beyond that. i mean it. it is: what are we doing and i think one of the things i have said when i first got here- and i've been saying since i got here and i keep getting reassured that we're doing some of these things- but one of the things i said is that we need to have trainings for anybody who gets permits, for the parents, for the coaches, for anybody that's working with our kids on the fields. you should, if you have to bring a gun to a field to watch your kid play, if, if you don't have total self-control, then don't come to the game or don't bring the gun. i mean, it's just, it's ridiculous that our kids are in such jeopardy while they're supposed to be enjoying. yesterday, so many kids left that area in such trauma that it makes me sick that one person could do such damage to so many people because they had couldn't control their temper in a split second and so and they were just so much more than just a 15 year old kid. so you know, if they're, if you're having an issue on the field or something, call the police, let them handle it and and let other people you know handle who have, who are calmer, but just don't bring your gun out out of the car or whatever onto a field when kids are there. so that's it for me. i just i'm going to say that i'm going to look into more what we can do to try to make sure kids are safe, but i honestly don't know what more we can do. i mean, it's just, it's getting ridiculous. thank you, councilman calcule. thank you, and yeah, i just wanted to acknowledge, as councilman kill smith said, we had some troublemakers from district two come up to brookline the other day and i don't need a gun. you better watch it. but no, i really wanted to thank commander ripple. you know he was on it right away. you know hysteria going around people. you know rumors people were shot. nobody was shot, nobody was killed, thank god. obviously this is one of our biggest small parks here and this was their first Psychology show. so imagine, there's these hundred and elephant in front of you. you know there's of them. there's measures and cameras. that's going in front of the custody of all of these Betty Putxx police and they need to be hurry up and especially send a rescue plane with a single shooting range at any given time. there's hundreds and hundreds of kids, whether they're in the rec center, on the Court. i know councilman wilson's son plays at the deck hockey rink there. so yeah, so, so. so i just really wanted to thank our police department, in in specific commander ripple, for informing me, letting we know exactly- you know- where they were in the investigation, what happened. they did, i believe, have the person in custody now, or they at least know who it is. so So yeah, that's it, Thanks.
