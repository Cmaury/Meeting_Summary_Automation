Good afternoon and welcome to Pittsburgh City Council's Cablecast post-agenda on the 2024 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. This is for May 15- 2025 And, for the record, today we're joined by Council Members Wilson, Sharland and Warwick. Thank you for being here. Others might join us as the post-agenda hearing proceeds And we have some invited guests from Comptroller Rachel Heisler's office. If you'd like to, I'll open up in just a few minutes to introduce yourselves and to present your findings from the report Summarized for us. before we get into some questions and answers from council members, I just wanted to say- and I don't want to steal any thunder from the controller, But what we had talked about, I think you know, more than a year ago was, especially now as I'm sitting here as finance and law chair, to get into a regular rhythm with not just sending a comprehensive financial report- or, you know, in some cases, quarterly reports to counsel for consumption at our own pace, at our own speed, but also ensuring that the public is aware that we're actually really daylighting the work that's being done and getting into a regular rhythm for that. so more people are aware, aware of the conversations that we might be having internally, and more, more eyes are on this, this work that's done, this incredible work that's done every year and perhaps even more frequently than that. so with those sort of brief opening remarks, I'm happy to turn it over to our city controller, Rachel Heisler. Thank You, council person. so I'm just gonna briefly. I'm joined today at the table by my colleagues Andrew DeWitt, who's our special projects manager, Jamie Zala, CPA, who's our chief accounting officer, and to meet a dracowarth, who's our solicitor. sorry, she does a lot of things, but that is her title, and so I'm just gonna explain what the annual comprehensive financial report is. it is the financial report of record for the city of Pittsburgh. thousands of hours go into the annual production of this, which is handled primarily by chief accounting officer Zala, and it is a summary of all money in and all money out and and of all accounts that the city either has control of or of our component units. so the financials from the URA, SCA, PWSA and the parking authority are all included in various part parts of this report. I'll just briefly give some high-level numbers. if any of my colleagues want to in as well, please feel free. but we 2024 was a good year for the city. right, we are concerned moving forward, but, as we highlighted when i started in this position last spring. there are concerning trends moving forward, but 2024 overall was a decent year. we brought in 7. 1 million more than it's spent. that's on a gap basis, which, if anybody has questions about gap, find gap numbers versus operating. jamie's the person to answer them. it was an increase of 25. 6 million. again, these are gap figures, the day-to-day figures, the sip, which is how the city operates. on a cash base basis. we collected 703. 6 million and spent 699. 7 million. those figures do not include transfers out. so the 10 million dollars we send to the ura for the housing opportunity fund, the money that's transferred to the stop the violence fund, those are not included because transfers out are not budgeted. some bright, really bright spots in the revenue. on the revenue side of things, our investment earnings were exceptional. we ra. we brought in 28 million dollars in investment earnings. i think everybody would be in agreement that those figures are on very unlikely in 2025. if you look at the historical average, we brought in between 2 and 2. 5 million dollars a year in investment earnings. a lot of that is attributable to the treasurer, gula, and her team, who invests the fund balance, and they have done an exceptional job. other, we've rebounded from the pandemic in terms of amusement taxes and parking taxes. deed transfer is a concerning spot, so it's. we have the highest transfer tax in the country, at five percent, and we fell short of budget by 11. 2 million and finished the year at 47. 9 million. it's down. that was down from an all-time high in 65. 4 million. real estate: again, this is not a surprise to anybody. we finished the year at 143. 4 million, which is 8. 2 million under budget. this is a 5. 6 million dollar decrease from 2023 and down from an all-time high of 153 million. in 2022, we issued 33 million in refunds, which does not include the voided refunds, lst, the local services tax, that's that 52. 2 dollars that we collect on people who commute in. we finished at 13. 5 million in 2023 and 13. 7 million in 2024, which was under budget. it Payroll prep: $75. 8 million, which is $3. 9 million more than we collected in 2023. These figures collectively represent a generally stable but job â€“ let me rephrase that: It explains to us that the job market is stable, but job creation remains slow. So facility usage fee: we're all on the same page with that. we don't know if it's going to be an income or revenue that we can bring in after the Supreme Court reviews and determines what they're going to do with that. most of our money, most of city revenue- more than half comes directly from city residents in the form of real estate taxes and wage taxes. that is a concerning point for me because I think that it's you know. we need to make sure we're diversifying revenue and that the burden of city government isn't falling exclusively on the shoulders of the people who live and work here. money goes to public safety- an overwhelming majority. highway and streets is also a significant part- and then general governments, at about a quarter. the unassigned fund balance grew considerably in 2023, expanded by about 25 million dollars. last year was effectively stagnant. we only added a million dollars to the general fund. as I've mentioned, we're expended, expected to spend more than a hundred and I think 120 million- 130 million from the fund balance over the course of the next five years. with that, I'm happy to if any of my colleagues have anything they'd like to add, and I'm happy to open it up for questions. I don't want to go through and go line by line, unless people want me to do that, because it can get confusing with numbers. no, we'll wait for questions, okay, thank you. well, i will. i'll start with questions from other council members and if anyone has questions i'd like to go first. we can do it that way. otherwise i can start from the end of the table and kind of work this way. but all good, council member warwick, do you have any questions at the top of your head? we can also have several round. so, like the process, who all is involved in creating? i'll turn that over to to jamie for the nuts and bolts of it. so it's really a kind of whole building does. my team is the one that more puts a lot of this together. we do a lot of entries. we work pretty closely with mara dussel, who are our external auditors, because while we're doing this we're also being audited. so these are all audited numbers. but my office- we reach out to a lot of other departments within the city to get the information that we need to make the entries that we need to do. like we said, this moves from our day-to-day cash basis into a modified accrual which is required for the acfer for the audit, which is basically changing it for timing purposes, moving some buckets around for accounting principles. so there's a couple different parts and this is this also goes along with it being part of an audit. so they're also working with our external auditors where they're asking for documentation. but for some of it there are pages within here that is put together by OMB. so how much I look at i know pretty much right where to turn. pages 9 through 12 are reports. i generate them in my program and i send off to omb for them to verify it, change anything they need to change for it. this is the actuals to budget are for some of those real estate we work closely with because we need to get certain reports for us to make any entries to do uncollectible amounts. there there's a couple different things. in order for us to make certain entries, i need to get information from other departments to do to do so. okay. i'll just add: every city department has something in this book, okay, and that includes our component units as well. i mean, everybody has. we've heard, we've gently reminded multiple times through the first quarter of the year: hey, we need these figures, we need these figures, we need these figures and I just can't overstate how cooperative everybody is through this process. it's a lot of work and it requires a lot of man-hours from our team in particular, but from everybody in OMB and finance in particular, I think it probably weighs the most heavily on, and we have robust cooperation from all the other departments. can you explain for me a little, just so i can understand? is the the cash in the general fund? so you said that it was around 200. we have 100. yeah, we have 199 million dollars in the rainy day fund. the fund balance. okay, that is the balance. okay, does that also i? what is it normally is that it's very high. it's very high and very healthy right now. okay, government gfoa. the gfoa recommends a 10 balance: 10 of expenditures and that's the unassigned fund balance. so money that is sitting waiting, is that's encumbered, is not included in that amount of money. okay, so, like projects that are rolling over from year to year, that wouldn't be included. it's the unassigned balance. it's money that's available to be spent. okay, so that, so, so the rainy day fund is good then. yes, yes, okay. so the concerning part is the trajectory forward and just how much we're going to weigh or how much we will rely on that for general operating between now and the end of 2029, and the budget right now will get us to that 10 at the end of 2029. okay, so, okay, so, so you're. so you, so it's good. now you're just worried about, yeah, and the trend going forward, yeah, yeah, yeah, and the reliance on it, because once you hit that 10 percent and at the end of 2029, if you're not, you know, doing anything for cost control or doing anything to grow revenue, you're going to continue to spend down the fund balance. so we just need in my- does that make sense- like we're spending operating out of the fund balance. you're we're budgeted to do that year over year for the next five years and my concern is, if we can't figure out how to increase revenue or control costs, that that trend will continue and we will spend down the fund balance. okay, all right, i think that's all my questions for now, but i'll probably have more as we go along. sure, yeah, thanks, council person. charlin, all right, thank you for being here and you know i appreciate all of your guidance from from all of you all throughout the year. you're an invaluable resource to me in my office, so cannot appreciate you enough. i want to start off so you mentioned that the that 2024 was a strong year and that you know from what you're seeing you're, since the tone is that you sound like it's happy and- and i would like you to explain on that a little bit- yeah, so 2024 finished where we thought it would right and And the concerning year was never 2024 And, as I've stated numerous times, if you're sounding the alarm while you're in the middle of a crisis, you didn't prepare appropriately. The most concerning years are 25 and 26, where these bond payments are going to balloon. We have a steep cliff with, I mean, we put 40. Let's get to that in a second, But let's talk about 2024 for right now. OK, So what is it on 2024 that you are like? what are some happy spots? What are some happy highlights? Yeah, so we've rebounded from the pandemic which we primarily noticed in the amusement tax and parking, Both finished above budget. We, for me, I am thrilled And I mean the investment earnings are just remarkable, And I want to again credit Treasurer Gula and her team. The strategy behind that was, I mean, it's really remarkable. So for me, yes, we finished the year basically where we thought we would. $45 million of our operating budget came from the American Rescue Plan Act, So that's money that we can't rely on. moving forward, I do think it's unrealistic to assume that investment earnings will continue on that level too. but those were more bright spots. you know we are not losing the LST and payroll prep being steady is, you know, better than them? not. so those are encouraging numbers. eit, our wage tax, is again finished over budget, and but only slightly so. those are the places that i i'm happy about. the trends are what i'm most concerned about moving forward, sure. so one of the things that we we hear about a lot is a four million dollar surplus from 2024. can you tell me what a four million dollar surplus in 2024 means? so i what i will tell you is we, i think the best way, we. the four million dollar surplus does not include the transfers out because they're not on the on budget. so we, our operating funds, had a four million dollar surplus. that is accurate, but that surplus does not include the transfers that we make to the housing opportunity fund, stop the violence fund, the 2. 5 million dollars that go to the ura for the housing, housing bond. i forget what else there was this year, but those numbers are not included in that figure and i i don't have the cover sheet in front of me. i should have prepared with that. what, how much do we spend in transfers every year or we don't? how much do we transfer in transfers? i think the number in 2024 was at least 25 million. well, it also includes whatever pay go. so i believe what was budgeted for 2024- and this was from earlier presentations- was about 22 million. that went to pay go. i believe. no, yes, just pay go. and then the rest was right. there was a small balance for early childhood, early, and then there was the last for a tech modernization. this is the last year we're doing that. is that right, correct? yeah, and that ends up. i again, i don't have in front of me about 50 million, something like that. is it right? ballpark, okay, so the four million dollar surplus is before the, the trans, the 50 million dollar transfers. yes, yes, so that overall expenses were less than what we brought in collected. i just think that's an important clarification that gets gets missed a lot and the. the nuance of this is, you know. that's why we've got people like, like you, to be able to help us understand this. so let's talk a little bit about this year, the current year that we're in, not necessarily the trends that we're going to see, but this, this year so far, you know, as you're looking at last year's numbers, as we've, we've worked on making sure that that the controller's office has the opportunity to certify revenues. what, what are you seeing this year? that is, you know, peaking your interest. i'll start out and then i please feel free to to share your thoughts too. we are expecting that tax revenue will be down significantly below budget in 2025, payroll prep being the most notable variance. the local services tax was down 12 and a half percent from q1 of 2024 and payroll prep was down 16 percent. i think we- i don't know that anybody- could have accounted for the volatility in the markets and the tariffs and the way that that's going to increase costs. but again, our office doesn't certify expenditures, we certify revenues. so, just to be a point of clarification on that, deed transfer continues to be down again. a lot of that is the economic indicators that are happening on the macro level. so you know, if the economy slows, it's much less likely that people are going to buy and sell homes and, as i mentioned, that fell below budget in 2024. the all-time high, i think, was above 60 million in 2022. so, as it relates to revenue, i think that there are things that are are macro, like like on the- you know big picture level, that we should be very weary about, and i i believe that when we made our revenue certificate, revenue projection certification in august and then again later in the year because a couple numbers had changed, I believe that they were accurate. I do think the national financial picture is changing and that will have significant consequences on city revenue in 2025 and probably into 2026 as well. so one concerning thing that I noticed is that I'm not sure if I believe this will be the first year that this happens, but it will certainly happen next year that we will gain more of our revenue from earned income taxes than we will off of property taxes. I believe this year that, if I'm correct, the numbers are very close. next year it should earn income, should take over property taxes. I see that as a pretty concerning trend for a city of our size. how, what does that mean? you know for the controller's office? what do you? do you think that? that? what story does that tell i my worry with? well, the first thing i'll just say is that we need a county-wide reassessment and we need to stabilize real estate and in for the city of pittsburgh, but also for all the other municipalities. it makes it very difficult to plan and i recognize the challenges with that. but i- just i, as a point. i think that that needs to be said. wage taxes are stable, which is good news. i am 25 of our taxable real estate in the city of pittsburgh comes from downtown. that property is worth less than it was five years ago. we, you know this is not news. i want to make sure that we aren't pricing people out of neighborhoods and homes and properties that they've lived in for decades, particularly folks who have stayed here. so that's, you know, something that i think we need to mitigate against. but i, for me, i am- are with wage taxes where they are. to me they dictate that our local economy is stable, but it and people are probably earning a little bit more money. but i want to make sure we're doing everything we can to expand that pool of people who maybe don't own a house here but work in the city and live in the strip district, live in greenfield, live in hazelwood. so that's what i'll offer on that commentary. i don't know if namita or anyone else has, i mean, part of this report and part of, i'd say, the goal, you know of what the controller's office is is, as we're continually monitoring city finances, is to remain independent and objective. you know it's not big news in in the country that costs are rising significantly and And a lot of people aren't baking as much to accept all of those things, And you know, as far as you know, even with the city collecting revenue. So I think, just like many other families, need to evaluate their own budgets and be committed to strategically planning how to address this. this is sort of, you know, a sort of warning light of of of our office and just making that suggestion that, for those that do budget and authorize that budget, that this just needs to be looked at and planned on moving forward. what i'll add to that quickly is that you'll often hear conversations about how people are penalized for living in the city because they have to pay the city wage tax, right, but our real estate tax tends to end up end up being lower than the outer burbs, but you're not seeing that real estate tax on your weekly paycheck, right? so with the common level ratio down to where it is, it's not actually surprising to me that these are converging our real estate tax and our earned income tax revenue. the amazing thing is that the city is growing little by little. i think there was an article that came out today that were up about 3 000 folks, which is wonderful to hear, but we need housing for them, right. pittsburgh remains one of the top 20 most competitive renters markets in the country. there are- don't i know it, there are- consistently, you know, pieces coming out about how much our rent has increased for folks. i believe the average number of applicants on a rental property in pittsburgh is eight right now, if i'm remembering from the last time that was studied, which is a lot. i mean, we're not a big city, right, and so some of this is also addressing housing availability in creative ways. if we do have more renters, we are going to see less in real estate tax directly, right, but that can ultimately turn up in great ways for our earned income tax for other areas of city growth. so, while it's something that i certainly am interested in keeping an eye on, i think our office is interested in keeping an eye on- it doesn't necessarily mean that there are negative consequences. it just means that it's something that we have to track and make sure that, as real estate income goes down and earned income goes up. we're not losing folks in the process to unaffordable housing prices. yeah, yeah, and you know it again, there's a there's a housing angle on in every conversation that we have here at this table and and in every policy. you know, and by by and large, pittsburgh is still a very affordable city, you know, compared to our national competitors. the again, the the concern is that it is. you know, there's a difference between speed, and you know speed and acceleration and we are accelerating quickly into being an unaffordable city because of our housing market, the way that it is. you know. again, i think this is something that i i see as just pittsburgh is changing and but i am, you know, going to continue keeping an eye on on that, i guess, with i want to make sure that i'm understanding the purpose of the ACFER correctly and make sure that my explanation of what we're doing here is correct. And so the way that I see the ACFER is it's not showing if you are in good financial shape as much as it's showing. this is what your bank account says right now. It doesn't. you know, you can look at my bank account and say that I'm doing okay, but it doesn't say what my rent is, or student loans. There's very little in the ACFER that's forward looking and it is a it's a like retro. it's a yearbook right of where we finished the year before. the 2020 q1 numbers are things that we did in the month between, in april, while we were wrapping this up, just to give policymakers a look onto where we were financially moving into 2025, and there are trends that you can look throughout here. i mean you can look up demographic and economic statistics, you can look up city employment in the last ten years, so it does provide a bigger snapshot than just the last year, and there are trends that you can, of course, derive from that when you see something growing year over year, over ten years. like you know, those are things that you should, we should, review and if there are conversations to be had. but it is a yearbook, it is not a five or ten year projection. so our goal in being here for this and any other report or audit that our office produces, is to inform you. you know I I'm also like just really proud of this report and the work that goes into it is just like unbelievable. so, you know, for our staff too, I think it's an opportunity to showcase. you know the work we do day in and day out, because you know, often you don't see the checks going out, right, you don't hear when, the when, when the bill is paid. so I think it's an opportunity, and it also is an opportunity for a conversation, right, this is where we finished, this is where we think we're headed, and what? what discussion do we now need to have around that? all right, well, that see if I have another round of questions here, but I will pass it to my colleague here. thank you, councilman Wilson, thank you, chair, and thanks for coming today and great to see all the, all the faces at the table. and i wanted to get right to the point of what i was reading when i saw the, saw the report, which was: do you feel that our finances are prop, are being properly managed in terms of the five-year plan? i think that if trends continue that, this is not a sustainable path and i think that the, the, the conversations, particularly around the expenditure side of things, it's a shared responsibility. our office doesn't budget, but city council does, as well as as the administration. so i think that that needs to be a more robust conversation. we are, as andrew has said, a neutral party until we look at something afterwards where, you know, my goal has not been to tell you to spend money here or spend there, and i am very conscious of the intentional boundaries around these offices and these functions, but i, if these trends continue, particularly given the macro economic factors at play, i do not believe that it is. our finances are in a sustainable position. so, from your end of the table, how? what changes will be made to the five-year plan to reflect a like in the next year's budget, to reflect a well, first off, maybe next year's budget? but is it appropriate for council to ask the mayor, since we're out of the window, that we could open the operating budget? is it, you know, is it ever the recommendation of the controller's office that the mayor opens the operating budget and we make adjustments now? i mean how we're basically halfway through 2025? i what i would encourage- and this is what i said at the table when i was here for our offices budget hearing- and i don't know when that was after thanksgiving- there are concerning factors that we have in terms of our budgeted expenditures. as a city, we've been very vocal about overtime spending and making sure that we're budgeting appropriately for that and from my perspective, you know I'm not gonna. I don't think it's appropriate for me to go line by line through expenditures, but what I will tell you is that expenditures, you know again, on the macro level, things are going to be more expensive. it appears that we are going to bring in less money than we had budgeted for on the revenue side. so those two factors alone, you could conclude in any scenario that it isn't sustainable for the next. you know, if this was a one-off and we expected things to rebound, i might have a different opinion. but the economic situation is is, while fluid, appears to be like it's headed in the wrong direction as it relates to, you know, the us economy and, given those trends, it makes me concerned. that's something i was interested in, you know, in terms of recently, in the past couple weeks, especially thinking more deeply about the concerns, especially this year and also the five-year plan. i mean, we're not budgeting- we saw this council saw this, you know, appropriately- for overtime and especially now since the storm happened, which no one could control, but that will definitely increase the amount of overtime. so it seems like a good if we want to be good financially, we would make that request to the administration to open the budget so we can readjust things so that we wouldn't have to take away services in the future. so the one thing i would say about the storm is: the thing that's important to budget for is things that you can't predict or control right. so- and that's true for anything i mean- we're killing the planet. we are going to see more significant and severe weather events happen, like that was a once in a lifetime storm in 1925, but it's 2025 and that could happen in six weeks. i mean, i you know, when you look at all these ancillary issues, whether you know just it's. you have to budget for a worst case scenario, not this is what we hope, we where we land, particularly with matters like that. let me refocus the question: what threshold would you, what recommendation? i understand that there's limited amount of you know, using that word recommendation- what threshold would you use as a guiding post for how much, let's just say, overtime, overtime pay increases in a quarter where we would you know where it would be a almost we were being negligent on the council side if we didn't make a request to the administration to open the budget so we can readjust spending. what i would say from the perspective of last fall- because i think that just mechanically i can speak better about the year- is: if you're going, if there's going to be a reduction in budgeted hours for overtime, for example, what operational changes were made to avoid those overtime costs? and again, i have no idea what information was provided to you all, but very little, okay, very little. the. the answer that i was given was that they would have to look into it more at the administration. so my understanding is that they actually are not in control of what's happening and they have to go and ask departments as to why those would be increases. and so i'm really concerned about the leadership of how overtime is happening. i feel like it should start at the top, especially whenever alarms are raised on on your side of the table. and it seems pretty negligent for council to move, continue to move forward, especially if we see in the in the second half of of the year that spending is continuing to increase in terms of overtime, and that doesn't even get to what we're talking about in the five-year plan. so i think what bothers me the most is that we're not being honest with the public about how the five-year plan totally diminishes how we will actually provide services to this, to the residents pittsburgh. when we talk about our most vulnerable residents, i mean in the fight let's, let's look at them in the five-year plan. you know what's there for small businesses at the ura, what's there for spending on paving, what's there for spending in general. i'm seeing multiple accounts zeroed out in the five-year plan and it seems like not only we did a poor job of asking questions that would literally get to the bottom of how they would manage the situation when we passed the budget, but i'm now seeing that you know, there are multiple failures in leadership, not specifically even finances, but in broad, broad, broad strokes in terms of how we will actually create revenue and have a conversation about council, how we create revenue, and one way i would think we create revenue is to get more tax dollars through real estate and not go to city planning and completely halt development, because there is, you know, all developers are concerned about inclusionary zoning with no real incentive to build. so right now we're in a. so let's, let's just paint this picture: right now we're in a state where we literally halted development because they don't know whether or not they're gonna have to do ten percent. they don't know if there will be, you know, a specialized alert for them in terms of at the school district or the county, because we can only control. we can do here at the city. so now we're not going to get that revenue that we- i mean this is all planning like building takes, you know, two years to. you know, even build some of this stuff. that's new tax revenue and i fail to see how you know we're gonna, we're gonna get anywhere in terms of increasing that revenue. we continually go on the path of not consulting council on best strategies to grow the city and you know, i'm just making a blanket statement saying that feels like gross mismanagement of city practices. i'm sorry, common practices, that that happened between the administration and the council and i feel like the ball is being dropped on both sides. but you know, from my angle It looks like we can definitely have better leadership in terms of from the administration to tell us what the realities are of how they're administering government. I recently had a conversation with someone who said: well, don't you vote on the budget? Yeah, But you know who you listen to when you vote on the budget is the administration. You know who can fire the grass cutters when they don't go out The administration. You know who can actively control overtime: The administration. so you know we believe how they would handle it. and you know we're sitting here. i don't have anything in my inbox after a leadership meeting. we're sitting here two weeks after that topic was brought up by how the overtime pay is. so you know, so much has increased. i don't have any answers. i don't know. does anyone here have any answers? i can give it over to any counselors, RIGHT NOW, IF THEY HAVE ANY ANSWERS, AND THE ADMINISTRATION CAN COME UP HERE AND TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON. I WELCOME THAT. YEAH, THANK YOU, COUNCILMAN JAKE POLLACK, DIRECTOR OFFICE MANAGEMENT BUDGET AND DEPUTY MAYOR COULD. YOU IS IT COULD YOU RESTATE THE QUESTION. YOU'D LOOK, YOU'RE LOOKING, FOR ME TO ANSWER. OUR FINANCE CHAIR WROTE A LETTER TO THE ADMINISTRATION ASKING them asking: yeah, yourself about, you know, with the concerns, and i won't, you know, speak to every line of the letter, because? but the spirit of the letter was: hey, what's going on? sure, i'm not sure if i can, if i'm paraphrasing too much, just let me know, because i'm not the one that wrote the letter, but i'm in full support of finding answers to how overtime is getting so out of control, right, especially in a time whenever, just like the controller mentioned, like we have to account for major storms that we can't. we can't predict storms that you know, obviously that's you know, storm like that hasn't happened. there's multiple things that haven't happened. it means you know every, every year, every two years, every three years- it doesn't always have to be wind and and, and you know, sideways, rain and all everything that you know came together that night whenever all the trees came down. and so in that leadership meeting, you know it was brought up and i haven't received any real answer. as to you know, i saw a lot of, i heard a lot of speculation, but i think the public should know how the administration is going to address council so we can make informed decisions. i mean that the ball was in your court to open the budget. it's past that time where we can make any changes to the budget, so our time is over. we listen to you at the other side of the table in the fall. so just trying to understand how we're going to continue to go on this path, sure so? so, as we indicated at that time, we are preparing a response to the both the concerns raised by the controller's office and the and council finance chair regarding overtime in conjunction with the first quarter report, which is, we believe, to be the appropriate time to provide commentary on things that happened during the first quarter, when all of the analysis of spending, revenues and spending for the quarter is complete. so all that we asked at that time was that we be able to complete the work on the first quarterly report in order to provide those answers, because there are insights to be discovered in the process of completing that report that help answer some of those questions. that report, i believe, is IS DUE TOMORROW AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING FINALIZED, RIGHT NOW, SO HAPPY TO ADDRESS WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED IN THE COURSE OF THAT ANALYSIS, THAT IS IN PART INCORPORATED IN THAT REPORT AND IN PART CAN BE ADDRESSED AS A RESULT OF THAT REPORT HAPPENING. AND ALSO, JUST NOTE THAT I BELIEVE STRONGLY IN THE PRACTICE INSTITUTED IN CODE OF PRODUCING THOSE QUARTERLY REPORTS FOR EXACTLY THIS REASON THAT IT IS A MECHANISM BY WHICH WE SHARE with council and the public the status of revenues and expenditures over the course of the year. but we need the full accounting to be closed for the first quarter in order to produce the report? do you feel that it's acceptable that you don't have an immediate understanding as to why there is such a disparity in terms of projected in the first quarter versus what was spent? no, because in order to spending patterns are not consistent over the course of the year. so, looking at the first quarter alone, and, in particular, looking at at the time this issue was raised, not even a fully completed accounting of the first quarter does not, on its own, answer those questions without further analysis. you know the- as the controller mentioned right, the. The reason that the annual comprehensive financial report looks at the year in its entirety is that, looking at the full year, you know accounts for those variations, month over month or quarter over quarter. So what I can tell you about the first quarter of 2025, as relates to overtime in public safety, what we saw, what we alluded to in our initial conversation about this but took further research to dig into more fully, is that, first of all, in the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services, an extensive portion of the year's annual training which is conducted on overtime pay occurred in the first quarter. So that lines up with the first quarter, overtime in EMS being higher in the first quarter than over the course of the entire year, And so that accounts for a portion of the increase in overtime. we've seen what was the. you said you're commenting on ems. i'm starting. i'm starting with ems. yeah, why let's narrow down that one? so ems conducted some extensive trainings for ems personnel, particularly those who participate in the dive team, in the first quarter. those trainings happen on overtime, but they don't happen every quarter, they don't even happen every year. so so yes, we saw increased overtime spending in ems in the first quarter. we also saw just ems. how much did we go over on ems in the first quarter? 66, okay, so give me a. is there a million dollar number, a hundred thousand dollar number? i can look that up right now and see if i can find out my phone. so you do believe that diving school was the reason why. so we're 66 over the budget, not on its own. there was more information that i was: yeah, that's where i'm providing, that's where i'm totally yeah, just not really understanding what you're talking about. so, again, we budget for the amount of overtime we expect in the over the course of an entire year, and that includes both sketch, you know, anticipated and unanticipated overtime. do you have any other information on that? i've heard training was a portion of it. another portion of it. one of the reasons which we did discuss at length during the budget hearings last year in testimony when asked on multiple occasions about projected lower spending on overtime- in still with ems- again we can address other cost centers- was that the transition in the new contract with the paramedics union to allowing for combo units would reduce the number of mandated callbacks for paramedics. do you think i want to just pause here for a second controller? do you think that we should, like council should, try to have an understanding of what quarterly we're going over? because as money gets tighter, we just listen to a whole year and there's what's being spent. so whenever there's a report that comes out and says we're 60- 66 over on ems- and we have, you know i understand you're saying it's- i mean, although i i'm going to take it at face value to say you have to look into it. you know you're sitting here at the table, we're having a real discussion about what you know currently, so you have to look into more than just what you know them going to diving school. but i'm just i'm taking on face value. there's there's somewhat more to it. but should we have better accountability on the council side to understand how much we expect to go over each quarter? i'm just like trying to understand how we can do the best thing we can on our side. so i would argue that that overage with ems is not only accountable in diving and training. i mean, we- we were at 2. 3 million dollars the full at the end of q1. the total budget for overtime in ems was 3. 5 million dollars. so my question would be what operational changes have been done to modify spending and overtime? yes, there are always ancillary incidents or events, but it from my perspective. you know- and again we are not a budgeting entity- but it does appear that this is a concerning trend. yeah, just like you're, you know the numbers are alarming. so i'm trying to understand how this, based on the information that we're given with the report, like how do we make decisions? so this is why i would like to finish answering the question. the other, i think more significant- change that happened in the course of the first quarter is that we put the transition to allow for combo units between a paramedic and an emt into effect in march. so that was bargained into the contract but it took some administrative time for that to take effect. we estimated in our proposed budget last year, or in the budget proposal that we put before council last year and articulated at this table, that we believed that transition to combo units would dramatically reduce overtime in ems. that change was implemented during the first quarter, so at the beginning of the first quarter we were not seeing the impact of that transformation. we are seeing it now in the numbers moving forward after that change, and the reason for that, briefly, is because we can send an ambulance out without not necessarily having two paramedics, but having one paramedic and one emt, and we have a lot more emts. we no longer have to call back a paramedic in order to make sure that that ambulance goes out. now again, the full extent to which that will account for a reduction in overtime is not something I can today tell you will be the full effect over the course of the entire year, And these are figures that we do continuously monitor. There also is quarterly accountability for these questions in the form of the quarterly reports. So the reason that we stated at the time that this question was raised that we would be able to speak to it when we produce the quarterly report is precisely that. That is the mechanism that we have, And the reason that the quarterly report is issued 45 days after the end of the quarter is that there is a standardized system of conducting this analysis in that window of time. Yeah, quarterly report. you're saying that that's our communication. I appreciate that you're just literally saying what's in the you know, in the code of what has to happen. but my question pertains more of just like that is alarming 66, and i would like it not to be that way so we have a better understanding. i just would hope in the next budget round that we're talking about more specifics in terms of quarters, because money's getting tight and i know this. i want to make sure that i'm within what this hearing is about. i know it's about the controls report i was trying to have a better understanding of- i know i'm there and down on one. i brought you know director up here, but you know, getting back to you know that report. i mean the only the only question that i have for you, because i want to get back to the report. you know we. i see it as like we should reopen the budget so we can fix this. do you see that we should do. you feel that we should reopen the budget to make any changes- not at this time, based on the current information year to date, as well as what we have seen so far in the second quarter- that's not yet, you know, audited because those months aren't closed- but for example- and just to use an example, that response to something that was addressed earlier- you know we have seen significant increases in payments for local service tax and payroll prep that in 2024 came in in the first quarter. those payments were happened to be received in the second quarter this year. so while i do agree with the controller that looking at the first quarter numbers, you would see a significant drop in those revenue sources and you will also see that in the first quarter report, because the first quarter report stops at the end of march. we now know that it was a timing of payments issue. there's a significant degree to which the timing of payments is affecting that quarter over quarter figure, but that the gap is not as large as it would appear looking only at the first quarter. so on that basis, our assessment is that the on the both revenue and expenditure side, we are still very much within the tolerance of the approved 2025 budget and that any changes that need not changes, any adjustments that need to be made to remain within budget, can be accomplished through the normal course of administration of spending. so, no, i would not recommend that at this time. so i have a. i might have some more questions, but i want others to speak because i've been speaking for a while. do you think council should have more control to open the budget than they do? i can't remember where that law, where that law exists, maybe it's in the charter, how off, how you know, we can only vote on open the budget after a certain amount of time after we passed it. but you know, if there is a report, i mean, is there any like, should we propose to the public that council should, you know, have the ability to, you know, reopen the budget, you know, after you know, the first quarter, or, like, should we extend that amount of time? i'm not saying that i'm on the right, but council should at least have the ability to take action. you know, together, if we feel that way, and right now we don't have the ability to do that, we- i don't know that it's appropriate for our office, for me, to comment on that. but what i would say is i think that these conversations are quite helpful and informative and i think that the budgeting process, particularly as it relates to expenditures, should be more robust and engaging. i mean, there, i know that fire over time is exceptionally high. there was no fire here- budget hearing- so i think that those are opportunities to have conversations and to really get into the meat of things and, like, really analyze figures and- and I think that you know both sides of the well, three people participate in revenue projections, but the two that do expenditures- I I do think that there needs to be, I would recommend that there needs to be more conversation and a more robust analysis on the trajectory of where expenditures are headed. and I think, particularly given the cost increases of even just raw goods, let alone inflation, and and our need to employ people and pay them a living wage, i think that when you look at, you know, construction projects, they're going to go up by probably 25 over the course of the next 18 months. so i think that those conversations would be very informative and in terms of making sure that work as a city budgeting appropriately, yeah, i definitely, i definitely agree. i mean, we're going. cali rec center. there was a community in the community, not everyone, but some people were asking: you know, could we build more? and the project manager on the city side said: project costs are, you know, really high. there's. i don't see how we could do something that's bigger. so, yeah, definitely more challenges ahead and i'll, you know, give it up to the chair so we can continue on. i may have, you know, maybe a couple more questions, but thanks. thank you, madam chair. may i very briefly address that point. i just want to. i just want to agree with the controller's point. the increase in cost of building materials and building costs as a result of, at this point, even just the threat or or belief that the tariffs are impending, is a very real thing and we we wholly share that concern. in the united states, building materials are overwhelmed, I'm sorry, in Pennsylvania in particular, overwhelmingly sourced from Canada and the potential for for tariffs on Canada is having a big impact in those markets. you know those costs would relate almost exclusively to the capital budget. so it is something that we're monitoring as we look at cost increases or overruns in capital and that is, you know, unlike the operating budget, open to amendment at any time and we we may very well, over the course of the next few months, see more proposed budget amendment, capital budget amendments- to account for that as we're getting bids back on projects. but i just wanted to agree with that point and clarify that we we do foresee budget adjustments in capital for things like that. i mentioned capital project in cali because it's just evident that there is an issue with costs and that is how we mentioning capital projects, so that we understand that getting development going and having real estate tax, obtaining real estate taxes, that that's how we get that tax, and so that's i was painting in the picture of why, like even from the city side, we're going to the public and saying we can't build more. so that's just the point i was trying to make, how it relates to the actual operating costs. thank you, council member warwick, round two: did you have additional questions? oh, you didn't want to go. i'll, i'll just, i'll wait till the end. yeah, okay, yeah, just so. i guess i sort of shifted to the overtime thing. so just to, because i, you know, i when, when that report came, i had some questions too. so just to, kind of, and i appreciate the the responses to meet us from you. so, just so i'm under, so, so, the, so the totals, just with regard to the, to the overtime, it was that we have spent 39, or this was like in march, right, in q1, right. so we'd spent 39 percent of what was budgeted total, like across all departments for premium pay, right for right, like all forms of overtime. okay, so, so, 39 percent in the first quarter. and then i i had i had been curious about what, what it looked like in past years at the same time, right. so in and Namita, you wrote that this actually has been an ongoing problem going back to 2019, right. So in 2019, at around that same time, it was 39%. in 2020, it was 31%. in 2021, it was down to 27%. in 2022, 33%. in 2023, 31%. in 2024, 37%. So this is kind of something that has been a- And I don't know if it's an issue to solve, like in the larger scheme of things, but it seems like this is not a new problem. Yeah, Again, it gets to the seasonal variation question. Another reason why the first quarter is oftenâ€” so a reason that the first quarter is often- high- is that the first quarter includes the St Patrick's Day Parade, which is one of two events per year where there is a significant utilization of city public safety personnel where we are not reimbursed. so the marathon officers, paramedics, firefighters are working on overtime, but p3r is invoiced and pays for those costs, so we don't, we don't actually see those costs. the two events where that is not the case are the saint patrick's day parade and the 4th of July celebration. So we see spikes in overtime in the quarters that include those two events because they are non-reimbursed, significant users of overtime. That's another example of a seasonal variation that our analysis, since the report was released, indicated to us as mitigating factor. Again, I'm not suggesting that there are not other challenges that the flag on this issue doesn't uncover that are appropriate, but there are. there are numerous factors that we also see as explanations of the use of overtime in the first quarter that are not causes for concern but are rather results of seasonal variation in when events or training occur, or are factors that we accounted for in the proposed overtime numbers as a result of operational changes but that weren't fully hitting the books, if you will, during the first quarter. i will add, though we've ems finished 2024 with overtime. their overtime budget was basically double where it had been, and we also cut the budgeted amount, like the raw amount of money we had allocated for premium pay for both fire and police. so the percentage like year over year. but we have less money in that pot in 2025 than we had in 2024 by at least ten million dollars. so that percentage is fair. but at the same time, we're working with ten million dollars less, so we have budgeted less. so you would expect that that would track if those cost containment measures had been fully implemented, but we have not seen evidence. that is, and that's our concern. we have less money to work with. okay, yeah, and we would agree that, for a variety of reasons, we haven't seen those cost containment measures. they're not borne out in the first quarter numbers and for for reasons i've addressed. but but we do expect that overtime spending over the balance of the year will not reflect those same factors in its entirety. okay, and and then i don't know if you said here, but i, or maybe it was that for dpw specifically- is snow, because there was like so much snow. is that again? just, it's something. it's another source of, of seasonal variation that happens every year, right, or, more to the point, it is different every year, depending on how serious the winter is. and we do definitely see the most dpw overtime spending in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter, the season when it snows, and more in the first quarter than in the fourth, because there's more more winter storms in january, february and into march than there are typically in november and december. so we don't expect 25 percent of overtime spending to consistently hit in every quarter of the year, particularly in dpw, and i think that, yes, a snowy winter with more snowstorms than the previous year accounts for a significant portion of the overtime we saw in DPW this year. That's the most we can say with the data we have right now. It doesn't account for it 100%. Again, I'm not attempting to say that it accounts for 100%. And in the DPW spending there was also overtime utilization, not in street operations. that was also elevated and that we're examining, But that is a factor that was at play. Well, oh, and this is the reason we've raised the flag that we have, or concerning words that we've used, like the storm, that is in this pay, the pay tomorrow. sorry, it's been a long week, so it's in the pay tomorrow. So, from my perspective, you know, the reason overtime exists is for events that you can't plan for. but events that you can't plan for are increasing and not decreasing, right? So you have storm variability, and you know we've talked about the other ancillary economic impacts that are going to, you know, cause costs to increase, and, from my perspective, that's what we need to account for, not like there's one snowstorm, but the fact that these storms are going to become more common and more frequent. right, yeah, that's what i was going to ask was, with this recent storm, like if that, you know, yeah, i said we had lots of unexpected overtime, yes, and but but to the controller's point, right, that that that pay is tomorrow, the, so we're still getting the full picture of overall utilization. that data now exists because it's been filed, but we haven't had a chance to examine it yet. so then, going well, just so, this is just so, so, so let's say, for example, with the storm, right, so, in an unexpected event- and we're paying for, you know, not just, but you know lots of things around the storm, so would. is that where this rainy day fund comes into play? is that like mechanically? yeah, yeah, yes, so it, the rainy day fund, the fund balance, gives us budget flexibility year over year. the problem is, when you get down to that 10 or when it's at the 70 million mark, which is what the budget anticipates- the five-year budget projection at the end of 2029- you basically have no flexibility because it's at the 10 of expenditures which is required for the home or per city code and that was a leftover policy from act 47 that council- and i actually don't even know who adopted it- but or huh, okay, but we maintained- and i again think that's best practices, but there's there are also no teeth on that legislation. there's no mandatory cost containment. that happens when you, when the fund balance gets to 10 of expenditures. so that's again, you know, my big concern is making sure that we have the budget flexibility because when you look at what happened in 2020- which, again going back to this theme of these events are going to continue to happen with greater frequency- we had a like unbelievable and rapid decree decline in in month-over-month revenue for the city for six months and things sort of stabilized at the end of 2020, but we had six months where we- i mean that's why we have these bond payments that are in 25 and 26 now- because we punted them and that was the smart thing to do, but that's why we're spending 50 million dollars more in debt service over this two-year period, because we had to delay that payment. so, from my perspective, i think the thing that we need to do as a city is make ourselves as nimble as possible to respond to emergencies, and emergencies can look different. i mean they can look like economic emergencies, where you know everything costs more. they can look like a global pandemic and they can look like a storm that lasts for an hour and a half and has half the city without power for a week. so, from my perspective, that's why that fund balance is so valuable and you do use it in. you know, in years when the economy contracts and we- but last year the economy was growing and we only added a million dollars to that account. so that is concerning for me, moving forward, that you know we we weren't saving in 24, because that would have been a year that we would have been able to do that. but the purpose of the fund balance is to use it on down years, but when you create a situation where you're overly reliant on it, you hit a cliff. yeah, again, as, as a matter of the overall analysis, i completely agree. i think that our perspective is that unders, I would say that you use the fund balance to be there to rely upon in situations- unexpected situations and emergency situations like the controller described- and or, in cases of economic or financial volatility, to smooth the curve right So that, if so, that we're not dramatically increasing or decreasing city services for what are time defined challenges, right, And I think there are two challenges we have right now that are impacting the current projections and the current conditions. So one is, as the controller just mentioned, the increased debt service payments that we face this year and next year as a result of refinancing debt during COVID. We've known about those, obviously, since we made, since we programmed in the refinancing, and they've been reflected and addressed in the. speaking only for the budgets that i worked on, going all the way back to 2022's, the, but the 2023 budget as proposed in 2022, we saw that coming. we in we worked to ensure that the spending plans we produced accounted for those shifts, you know. but part of that is, you know, because we have this increased bond payment that we know will be paid off in 2026, right, that then, smoothing that curve of services, understanding that there is a finite endpoint to that. you know it is. it was in our estimation when proposing the budget that draws on the reserve fund in 25 and 26. to get to the other side of that, knowing that there's a significant change, starting in 27 WAS APPROPRIATE. THE OTHER POINT I'LL MAKE IS THAT THE THE CURRENT FIVE-YEAR PLAN SHOWS DECLINING REAL ESTATE TAXES EVERY YEAR, AND THAT IS PART OF THE FORECAST TO TO UNDERSCORE AND AGREE WITH THE POINT THAT THE CONTROLLER AND NEMEDA MADE THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE COMMON LEVEL RATIO DECISION, WHICH IS PUTTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE EVERY YEAR ON WHAT WE CAN COLLECT IN REAL ESTATE TAXES. and this also connects to councilman charlin's point. were it not for the common level ratio, we, we would not be seeing the earned income tax eclipsing real estate taxes. we, we, we have seen real estate tax revenue go down as values have gone down downtown, but we, we would not be projecting real estate taxes going down every year for the full five-year plan were it not for the common level ratio decision. and frankly, we don't anticipate that to actually be the case by the end of the five-year plan because we anticipate a resolution due to ongoing litigation around reassessment. right, but we can't forecast for a reassessment that hasn't been called for. sorry that has. it has been called for in litigation but hasn't been scheduled right because we wouldn't want to, for example, put it into the forecast that it will happen next year and then it turns out it doesn't happen until 2027 and then our forecast is wildly off right. better to show a very conservative forecast that assumes it will never happen and then be pleasantly surprised when, when, that adjustment can be made to the to the positive. so if that reassessment occurs within the confines of the current five-year plan, then the later years of the forecast will look much more favorable at that point. if it doesn't, we have a five-year plan that maintains our adherence to the requirements of the code, which was our effort in putting together the 2025 budget, was to show that we could withstand that entire period and we remain within those parameters, knowing it's unlikely to last that long, because we're not the only municipality or local government agency in allegheny county that faces difficult challenges as a result of the common level ratio case. i think we're in much better position than most because we do a five-year plan. i think there are a lot of municipalities that can't go another year, you know, like we'll see in their 2026 budget discussions this fall them really running into significant challenges as a result of this. but because they only budget a year at a time, they haven't future casted that condition yet, got it. so so what you're saying is just to kind of for the public, right, we, we do a budget in a given year, but we have five year. we actually budget for five years and that budget is: do you certified by the controller? is that what it is? we certify revenue projections. we are not a budgeting branch of city government, so we have opined in a what i would say a limited way on expenditures and expenditure projections, but we certify revenue for five years. okay, so you're familiar, then, with this revenue projections that are taking into account less. i mean, you know, assuming, based on things that we know, that real estate tax will, that that revenue will go down, yeah, and that is that was part of the five year plan. yeah, okay. and then i do just just quickly, because i mean this, this, this: there was a professor at pitt who released some census building permit survey that showed that actually built building permits in in pittsburgh have gone up significantly in the past couple of years. i don't know if that's something, yeah, that you're familiar with. i'm just wondering if that, you know, like this major skyrocketing of building permits could potentially mean, even if it's not part of the five-year projection, could maybe be a positive in that those could be so that graph tax is coming on. that i don't know, i'm not, i mean it's again, it's, you know, i want to, i want to, i want to. i want to both address why i think that those, those trends are positive, but also a few caveats, right. so? so the graph you're referring to includes basically the entire 21st century. it goes all the way back to about the year 2000, right. it correctly shows years in which- and- and it's not just building per, it's not all building permits, it's housing starts, new housing construction. it correctly shows that there were years in the 2000s when new housing unit construction in pittsburgh was in the dozens right, or even the, you know, less than 50 right. so the the graph shows an extraordinarily steep increase, because we were building almost zero housing in the first decade of this century and even into the second one, and that has a lot to do with the difficult situation we're in right now with housing supply and housing affordability is that we were not building any and then we moved very quickly into building a lot that was very expensive, right. so there are a number of things you can infer from that. however, i will say that, yes, the continued year-over-year increase in permitting is a good sign for real estate revenue, fee and permit revenue. when we're talking about housing income. you know that we were very glad to see, as it was addressed here today, the second year of modest but but ongoing population growth, right, which which signals, you know, that the kind of demographic transition from declining population to stable population, now the two years of growth. it suggests that you know we're headed in the right direction. it's far too soon to say, but it's a good indication. building in 2024 compared to 2023, so again, not looking at 25 years where, when it was so low at the beginning, the graph looks different. comparing 23 to 24, we issued about the same number of building permits, but the total dollar value of construction activity- because you you declare on the permit not just what you're building but also how much it costs- went up dramatically and we had a high, the highest. it was the highest value of construction ever in 2023, about 1. 4 billion dollars of declared value in construction. you know which, again, is a strong economic indicator like the the wage growth is. you know it is. in and of itself It doesn't tell the whole story because the economic inequality is a big factor that we have to account for as well when we see those things happening. But I think it does have the potential to have a positive revenue effect on real estate over time, only if we're able to fix the calculation of the real estate tax and that points back to the common level ratio. Also, just with regard to income, like the income revenues, income tax, wage tax revenues- do we- and maybe this is- is there any indication that? I mean it's something I would guess is true, but I don't know- is that folks are moving into Pittsburgh who make more money. Is that? could that be part of that increase? Yes, I mean I think the wage, EIT, wage growth does mean that wages are up. payroll prep, which is the text that the employers pay, is stagnant, which to me is concerning for growth. so I mean, on the whole, the wage tax. yes, I mean that is what it means, right if, if payroll prep is stable or even declining, but people are making more money. so, yeah, I mean I'm wondering to just generally wages going up, but also just higher earner, like higher income folks coming into the city- right, Yeah, the thing I would- Tech jobs and things like that that pay more. maybe then And again, this is more of a macroeconomic trend. but when you look at the sectors that are being most significantly impacted by this presidential administration, you know our largest employers are the ones that are going to be impacted. So I am very, very worried about, like even a hiring freeze with even one of our large nonprofit partners in the city would be very detrimental to wage taxes and the overall growth in the city. you know, I think what we're seeing with the deed transfer tax is actually like a early indicator of that, because people aren't, you know, moving from a three bedroom, three bedroom house in Greenfield to a four or five bedroom house in Greenfield if their family grows and instead are staying where they are, so that those macroeconomic trends are very, very concerning. and then when you look at potential cuts to federal reimbursement programs that pay for- you know whether it's Medicare or Medicaid, our hospital systems rely on those payments to, you know- balance their budgets. I mean they serve people who are using those program, insurance programs- and if those are curtailed in any way, particularly in the cruel way that is being proposed. i'm very, very worried about, like the economic conditions that will exist in in pittsburgh. agree that we suspect that the increase that, as the controller said, the the fact that the wage tax is increasing while the payroll prep tax is stable, is attributable to a combination of of people making more money at the jobs they already have, higher earners, moving in and replacing people who are, say, retiring right, And so same number of jobs but higher incomes, And also those two factors can account for the increases there. as relates to the deed transfer tax, I mean, I think that, yes, broader economic uncertainty plays a role. high interest rates play a role. The ongoing trend of renters representing a larger share of the city population will also play a role. right, Not that long ago, Pittsburgh was a majority homeowner city. We're now about roughly 60% renter city. so as more and more people are renting, that means there are fewer and fewer people purchasing homes. We know that to be true just as a matter, as a data point. A lot of reasons: there could be a lot of reasons for that, both on the buyer side and on the supply side, but as that happens, we would expect fewer transactions. So I think don't disagree with anything the control said. just adding a few more thoughts to that. And the other thing I would just flag for the purpose of this conversation: it requires its own post agenda, but school enrollment in pittsburgh public schools is down, which is a very concerning factor. for for you know someone who's worried about the financial future because if families are sending kids to parochial schools or private schools, it's effectively an additional tax and we need to do everything we can to make pittsburgh public schools a destination school district. we lost a ton of families during the pandemic and we haven't fully rebuilt that trust. and obviously that is a lot larger, larger conversation. but i do think it is a significant factor in terms of where people ultimately end up buying, if they choose to buy the work they're choosing to do, etc. just for the deed transfers. but because this is something we talked about at one point at the table, is that there- and correct me if i have this wrong- but is there like a loophole with these llcs that like buy a house and it's the llc and then they sell the llc to a nut, to someone, as opposed to selling the property? i don't know that real estate has tracked how often an llc is bought or sold or if they would even have that information. but that is a loophole. most deed transfer comes from residential, like i'm selling my house to you or your son, whatever, which is just it's a lot of paperwork for a single family home. you know, it's something to be aware of particularly. i mean there are a lot of issues that are associated with llc's buying a large number of residential properties. but from my perspective it it's like right now it's not. that is not the reason that this number is dropping. got it, got it. i just was wondering, maybe for, but it is an issue, and i mean there are again a ton of issues that come along with llc's owning residential property. that is one of them in the city. yeah, i just was wondering- because i had been thinking about that- if there was a way to kind of close that like have the deed transfer go with the enemy, whatever. that's a different, that's a matter of state, that's a matter of state. oh, that's a state, okay, okay, okay, i don't think. well, yeah, i do well. so again back to this rainy day fund. so it's healthy. now about 200 million, right, and you said, but you're concerned because we only put an extra million. so, yes, so i mean, when that is growing, it means you're saving money. you're over here, right? and when you go from a 23 million dollar increase to a one million dollar increase, it means you're saving less, got it? and when you look at the, the revenue and expenditure trajectory over the five-year plan, again, we're expected to get to the bare minimum with expenditures and money out. right, we'll have that 10 at the end of 2029. so is the current budget. so, just so, i kind of try, you know, because i this is not my strong suit, right, so i try and kind of understand things, like in terms of my own. So, like, I put money in my 401k every year, right, I put money every year in my 401k, but some years I put less, for whatever reason, right. But I still have, like that, savings there and I don't want to dip into it too much, right, You want it to be healthy, right, But it's there just in case. so that's, i don't know if that's a good analogy. i would say the reserve balance is more of like a savings cushion that you would have, right, for that rainy day expense of something. but strategically you can't without any plan and you're always relying on that without continually saving. if you're taking things out, oh i will, it's going to go out to you. so just so i'm so so, but but we knew coming in and again. so i mean- because i remember us talking about this for the last two budget cycles- like we knew coming in that 25, 26 was going to be tight, right, so i mean, would it again? i'm just curious, like and so so if, if we're, if we're not putting as much in this, in the savings account for 25, 26, because we know it's going to be tight, but that with the understanding that coming out of 20, then 27, 28, we're going to kind of be in a better place, because that, right, no like. so the trend continues. so the trend to draw from the fund balance continues after that's the issue. if it were rebounding and stabilizing at, you know, 120 million dollars year over year, i would be less alarmed. but to me the big concern is that that's expenditures outpacing revenue- is going to continue for the duration of the five-year plan. we don't budget for 10 years, like the federal government. so i can't comment on what 2030 and 20, 20, 31 are going to look like, but looking at the three years after these two big payments, it's it doesn't rebound. But I thought that we like have like a debt, There's some. it doesn't. it doesn't rebound because, at the same time, we are forecasting real estate taxes to continue to go down as well because of the common level ratio. So this is where the two, two observations I think we're making here like run into one another. Right And, but we were a few years ago- I can't I don't remember if it was for the 2024 budget, but I know for the 2023 budget- we were not forecasting declining real estate revenues because we had not yet seen. we were forecasting about flat real estate revenues because we had not yet seen evidence of the impact of the common level ratio case that would give us a sense as to what the annual impact would be. And at that time we did more or less show the type of rebound I'm generalizing that the controller's talking about. right, WE WOULD BE PUTTING LESS INTO THE RESERVE FUND IN 23 AND 24 AND THEN IT WOULD, IT WOULD REBOUND. WHAT HAS CHANGED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS IS WE HAVE TAKEN THAT CONSERVATIVE POSITION IN BUDGETING FOR DECLINING REAL ESTATE TAXES. YES, WE DO SEE THE TREND CONTINUE TO US. THAT IS EVIDENCE, FURTHER EVIDENCE, OF THE URGENT NEED TO RESOLVE THE QUESTION OF REAL ESTATE TAXES in allegheny county and the common level ratio case. if we were not having to forecast declining real estate taxes over those out years, i think we would have a very different picture as it relates to the reserve balance in those later years of the projection. okay, okay, well, this has all been info. i mean, it's a lot, it's a lot of information and i, you know, i i should know more about it than i do. so i appreciate you all thrilled to be here anytime you want to talk about it. so i do want to. just one thing: it's because there's so this is just, and i you know, because of the, the season that we're in and and you know i've heard the term act 47 thrown around a lot, right, just various folks, i've heard it on the radio and this kind you know. so, just so, so it's clear. so So the criteria for going into Act 47, this financial distress program, include expenditures exceeding revenues for three years, not making payroll for 30 days, failing to remit employee tax withholdings, defaulting on debt payments or failing to make pension payments. have any of these things happened. well, expenditures are expected to outpace revenue for the next five years. so I mean that is true. I'm not saying I- and I have reiterated that I do not believe we're on the brink of Act 47, like okay, but but that first factor is going to happen for the next five years, which is why I- again, my perspective has been the entire time that we need to have an honest conversation with City residents and let them know where things are headed and that you know you're out and someone's complaining that their alley hasn't gotten paved. it's probably not going to get paved next year like it just isn't. i mean the cost of petroleum is going to continue to increase, right, asphalt's going to be more expensive because of it. so from my perspective, i think the most important time to have that conversation with people is before you hit that point. so, but we expenditures are outpacing revenue and they are going to for the next, for the budget that you all voted on. that says that. okay. i think your question was: have any of those things happen? the answer is no. are they? are they? are any of them expected to happen this year? i would say the answer is also no, the whether they happen, whether we expenses exceed revenues in future years will depend on a number of variables. right, the? the forecast and the five-year plan are projections, not actual appropriated spending. right, nor are they year-end actual results, right, you know. so i don't. i don't believe that we are in a position that would make that condition unavoidable, right, we're not. we we can address with from where we sit today. there's no reason why that scenario has to come to pass within our existing ability to manage for these variables and depending on some outside factors, right, that we can't control, and this, this can't put into the forecast, i mean, i mean so, okay, so you? so councilman wilson asked: do you feel that there's anything we should do now? so we're about halfway through the year that we should do now again, this year, next year, i'm not comment, i'm not prepared to say anything about next year yet- right, because we haven't proposed a budget for next year yet. we'll. certainly. there are many things that, by the time we propose a budget for 2026, will be very different than they were, you know, in the fall of 2024 when we proposed the current five-year plan, and chief among them, the tariffs and the economic volatility that has followed the inauguration of the Trump administration that we'll have to take into account. I do not believe that there's anything warranting a reopening of the 2025 budget to make adjustments at this time, for reasons I already stated, that we're well within the kind of brackets of our ability to manage the expenditure issues that you know that we face right now. and is there any type of- i mean, i know you don't, but you know i don't know, because i always say this: right, like we're council, we look at the budget and then it comes and we approve it, but it's always like, well, what do you want to do? you know what i mean. like what, what would have to go? and i, i mean i just, i just know, over the past couple of years, like there have been a few things, at least that off the top of my head, like we have not introduced any new capital projects, for example. right to try and just sort of not be adding new things and actually, just, you know, finishing and doing the things that we've already budgeted some for and getting those done. is there anything else that you're looking at for next year, sort of with the same? yeah, i to, to, to being frugal and and trying to serve again. i, i, the, the, the budget process has a timeline. is on the timeline that it's on for a reason right? it's still too early, i think, to give you a clear, articulate answer to that question, because there's still a lot we have to observe before making those recommendations and ultimately making that proposal. but i do think that if the cost of building materials continues to increase as it has been consistently increasing- the cost of construction has been consistently increasing since the pandemic- first because of supply chain disruptions, then because of inflation and now because of inflation and tariffs, right. so we will, particularly in the capital budget, continue to face constraints and challenges and we do now have projects that continue to be delayed because between when the their budgets are set and when bids are received, costs have gone up and we have to adjust right. so that will continue to be a pain point and something that we have to address in the coming years. on the operating side of things, i, i, you know, we have every year identify, you know, produced savings, sometimes significant savings, in smart management of our insurance costs, our, our short-term disability costs, right, that produce savings and we can continue to. one that help us in the current year, hit the mark and two, that over the long term, we can factor into how we allocate or how we propose funding, but but be able to offer a much clearer picture of this answer in September when we produce the preliminary budget proposal. Okay, all right. Yeah, and I mean, I guess, just generally. I mean, I know that this is something we're all aware of. It's just, you know what are the ways that we can increase revenue without putting the squeeze on working class Pittsburghers- you know what I mean, Folks who are struggling, just to. you know, buy groceries, right, And I know that there are a number of things aren't able to do, which is very frustrating as a city. right, it would be lovely if we could charge people who come into the city. you know, use the tunnel to come into the city to go to work every day, right, i mean, that just feels like something we should be able to do as a city. my understanding is that we're not allowed to do that from this, yeah, i, i don't know, i'm not an expert, and i think it's state law, and then pendot is the only entity that can toll an interstate right. i just wanted to flag one thing. i was i had mentioned in an earlier point that the gfoa number for the fund balance is 10. the gfoa number is 16. 7, so we would hit that recommended threshold in 2028, not in 2029. the city code mandates 10. so when we're looking- okay, when you're looking at the fund balance, the current projections have us have us passing what the gfoa says is healthy in you know three, at three and a half years. when you say passing, you mean going below. yeah, sorry, excuse me, dipping, dipping below that threshold, the 16. 7 threshold, percent threshold in 2028, which is in three years. got it, but has us above or at what is mandated. man, yeah, there are no teeth in that ourselves. yeah, right, so there are no teeth in it. but the 10 is we would hit at the end of 2029, but the 16. 7 percent would happen at some point in 2028. shut it. further context on the fund balance: In 2020, before the city began spending out of it because of huge drop-offs in revenue due to the pandemic, before that, the fund balance was at $100 million. It's twice that today, right? So once the immediate impact of COVID on revenue were sort of rebounded, from which, in part, ARPA played a large role in- we have consistently utilized that opportunity to build up the fund balance for precisely these reasons: right To have as much cushion as possible for challenging times. So, before anybody knew COVID was going to happen and that there would be either a drop in revenue or ARPA, the balance was $100 million and going up modestly every year, But it was climbing, but it was half of what it is today. We've been able to dip into it, rebound to where it was and then double it since 2020. Okay, so, before COVID, like our savings was, you know, like what we had in the savings account generally every year, was around like $100 million. That's what it was at that point. It was have been going up every year to that point. But what about before that? do we know? I mean the fund balance bottomed out in 2020 or 2000- excuse me, 2004, I think it like three million dollars, Yeah, Okay, It was. and so like in like 2018, doing I mean you don't have, I mean I think it was a matter, It was at a hundred and thirty three million. and 2019, we spent about 50 of that in 2020 and then continued to rebound after the pandemic. okay, so, oh, i see, is this here's? is that, is that gap unassigned? so, okay, so, so, so this, oh, i mean, this seems like fairly significant. so in 2019, we had 133 million. in 2018 we had 114. this isn't like in our savings account, right? we had 114 million in 2017- oh, i'm going backwards, apologies, sorry. 2020, we had 85 million. that was coveted, presumably where we had to. it was like major rainy day, yeah, like big time rainy day. then, 2021, we had 109, 2022, up to 167, 2023, up to 198. so we've been saving money, actually, yes, so we've been really putting money in the savings account over the past few years. oh, yeah, i didn't even realize that. and so then now in 2024, we're at 199, which is significantly higher than we've ever been. i mean, of course, things are more expensive than the dollar, you know, i mean, i get that too. and in revenue, we were transferring from american rescue plan into the general fund as well. that helped, yeah, right, but that helped us still put money into the savings. like we, we got a par for money which helped us do stuff, and then in, in, instead of just being like, great, we've got arpa money and this money, let's just spend it all. we said: correct, we've got this arpa money, let's put, let's let's- the portion of the arpa funds that went to support the operating budget. It was labeled- well, I'm forgetting the exact label, but a portion of it was basically to avoid layoffs. right, That was the line, Right, right, Those were layoffs that the Peduto administration had projected they would need to enact, they would need to move forward with in July of 2021 if ARPA was not passed. ARPA was then passed, and so the cost to not lay those people off was part of the operating budget every year- 21, 22, 23, 24- And so that relieved pressure on the fund balance and general revenue, which allowed us to rebuild and, in fact, grow the savings account. So, yes, I mean that's, you know, I think that's. I mean again, I recognize the concern going forward, but I think that that is worth noting in terms of things that have been done over the past few years to make sure that we're financially well. if you look at page 186 in that book, you can see the number of FTEs have increased by more than 200 full-time positions in the city in the last two years. so that's, yeah, I mean, we're at that cross point where, right, you're gonna- and those are positions created, not necessarily, not necessarily hired, but that is a dramatic increase in that amount of time. so while we're socking money away, We will quickly and rapidly burn through that money if we're not careful. Many of those positions are not general fund positions. The places we've increased the FTEs the most are in planning and PLI, where they're paid for out of fee revenue. Oh, okay, okay, all right. Well, I think yeah again, I mean, right, increasing revenue, obviously it would be great. There's just there's so many things that I wish we could do. I wish we could charge people coming in the tunnel. I wish we could do a sugary drinks tax. I wish that we could. you know, I mean all these things that other cities do, right, like to increase revenue. you know, I wish that our nonprofit partners, would you know, help as well with these things. you know, because they, you know, if they were for-profit- specifically UPMC, I don't know what the number's like- they'd be 32 million or so a year in taxes that they don't pay because they're a nonprofit. So I know that's a sore point for folks across the city And obviously something we need to look at going forward. But anyway, I appreciate this. I appreciate everyone coming and having the long discussion. My takeaway is that these are definitely concerns, right, but it also feels like. these are concerns that you know we have recognized for a while now and that you know have, and we're working towards them. but I think that I'm hoping we can all continue to work together. you know, finance chair yourself, director go director Gula OMB, you know, continuing to work together, going forward. yeah, thanks, thank you. we'll move on to councilman wilson. i know he's a few things to say before he has to depart and then i'll make some remarks at the end. so i hope people will will stay for that. thank you, i have to leave pretty soon here and i wanted to make sure that i gave some final thoughts. so we have a lot of signals that tell us that things aren't going in the right direction. we have schools that are closing. prt is, you know, not currently funded at a level where they could sustain the current operations that they have. we have arbor funding that's going away. we can see the five-year plan where we have not allocated money for the land bank. we have not allocated money for, you know, all the typical things that we could, you know, continue to provide the level of service that we're at right now. i believe, when i look at the five-year plan- and i heard, i heard you know we're over on overtime and in the first quarter- and i heard this at the, the budget meeting, which was one of our plans- is to get more revenue with the, with the, not the cost level, the reassessment and my understanding- and i just heard that again here- my understanding is that that will not provide that much more revenue so that as a growth plan in terms of increasing revenue, doesn't sound like that is a real plan and i i spoke to the county about this and they're not unders. their understanding is that that wouldn't increase revenue in at a level that would get us out of this hole. does anyone that controller? do you have any thoughts on the? i'll let you meet us the most familiar with this as our office solicitor. yeah, so i think what you're referring to is the windfall provision that the county has, which says that if there is a reassessment then the county tax rate has to adjust down to avoid the county receiving a windfall. i can't remember the exact percentage right now, but it's quite small above a certain amount. yeah, and tax revenue, that's right. the city would continue to benefit from the elimination of the common level ratio. being at what it is now below 60. it allows us to continue to collect revenue and, more importantly, it allows us to continue to collect real estate revenue moving forward instead of real estate revenue stagnating. the hope is that this is not a one-time reassessment but that we all get ourselves on a plan to reassess regularly, frequently and honestly, in a way that to controller heiser's point- continues to protect our most vulnerable residents who have been in housing for a long period of time. but i do want to specify that the county windfall provision impacts the county directly, but it doesn't prevent the city from receiving revenue from real estate on a regular basis and the elimination of this sub-60 common level ratio would be a big help. we wouldn't see an immediate spring back. it wouldn't be that everybody's houses are suddenly 100 of their sale value and we're getting the total amount of money right like. that's not realistic, but we wouldn't continue to see this. so my point is: my point is that my point is that to rely on, so it doesn't sound like we're gonna get them. this is a long this is a hot topic. for a long time it's been taken. yeah, anyway it's. it's seeing a lot of different turns here. my point is: we're rely, like what i'm hearing from the administration is that the the growth pattern is is to rely on another government entity to do something, and i think that we need to have a real economic plan. i hear that- a real economic plan and a job plan. i'm not seeing that at all. what i'm seeing is: hey, look, the permits look like this in the year 2024. we must be good. you know, that was a good year. we don't know where the next permits are going to come from. that is, or the next bill, the next development is going to come from we- okay, yeah, loosely we do. they put a permit in, but we don't have any sort of plan to point to and say: this is our economic development plan we're relying on. from my understanding, you know different. you know different entities, like the allegheny conference, to devise a plan like that and loosely put together some- you know some- revenue to spur development downtown that we don't even have all that revenue. you know the 600 million dollars, that's, that's, that's. there's a lot that has to come together to make that happen, and so i'm not seeing the level of commitment from the city side to really fix this, this decline, and i would like to understand more from the administration on what the real growth plan. i know that you've been, you know, quoting the paper, saying that you don't even call back developers, like you kind of take pride in that. so i mean, that's concerning to me. you know you said that they had a really good time in the past administrations and i don't know if that's really a good direction for us to go go down and when. at this table i just hear you know the administration say that between the COMMON LEVEL RATIO AND WHAT ANOTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITY WILL DO, AND THE REASSESSMENT THAT THAT SOMEHOW IS GOING TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS, I'M NOT SAYING I FEEL LIKE. THAT'S A REAL CONCERN. WHENEVER WE HEAR YOU KNOW THE CONTROLLER SAY THAT WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT LOOK, WE CAN'T PAVE THOSE STREETS, YOU KNOW, IN COMING YEARS, AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT. WE'RE JUST NOT BEING HONEST WITH THE PUBLIC, WE'RE NOT SPEAKING HONESTLY, PUBLICLY, ABOUT THIS, AND I WOULD LOVE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE IN A BETTER FINANCIAL SITUATION BECAUSE WE HAD THESE HONEST CONVERSATIONS, SURE. SO, FIRST OF ALL, I I PLEASE KEEP YOUR ANSWERS SHORT. WE NEED TO WRAP IT BEFORE FOUR AND I NEED TO SAY A FEW WORDS BEFORE THAT, SO I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE TO SAY OKAY, THANK YOU. NO, JUST KEEP YOUR ANSWER SHORT, PLEASE, AND THEN WE'LL WRAP UP. SO, FIRST OF ALL, I DID NOT SAY THAT THE REASSESSMENT WOULD BE A SOURCE OF TAX REVENUE GROWTH. I SAID THAT. THE REASON THAT, AND FOR exactly the reasons Namita said that we, the annual formula by which the common level ratio goes down, is the source of us needing to project reduced revenue every year. a reassessment would change. that would reset the formula and would stop the downward pressure on revenue, which is entirely artificial and produced by the ruling. so I'm not claiming that. I'm not claiming that would be a property tax revenue windfall or increasing taxes as a result of reassessment. that is the solution. only that the now court mandated cut to real estate revenue every year would go away. for the reasons that namita specified as relates to other sources of revenue, again, i there simply isn't evidence other than rhetoric and conjecture to suggest that we are seeing losses or or a downward trajectory in investment, wages or building activity. right, so the the all the economic indicators, including now two years of population growth, don't support that claim. thank you all. right, so i want to thank everyone for your participation. i this is. it's clear to me that this is daylighting a lot of what our joint financial task force has discussed and that I take for granted because I'm a part of that but other council members don't necessarily. so, you know, really important conversation. the ACFER is one thing. it opened up a whole bigger conversation about many, many other topics and my hope going forward is that, as we discuss really anything, that we're looking at it through the lens of revenue growth and expenditure maintenance or, you know, consideration. because when I, you know my, my observations- more so since I've become the chair of the finance and law committee- is that, council, although we seek to grow revenues, we don't have direct control over revenues. right, we can set the table, we can, we can help set the table, set the foundation for an environment that grows jobs, that helps to start new people, grow new businesses or start new businesses to grow our population, to keep people from leaving the city, investing in vacant land, to get, you know, more properties back from the tax rolls. you know, but we're not part of, we're not part of, you know, a conversation directly with the nonprofits to get our bigger share. We do have limited capacity to implement new taxes and with expenditures. the challenge is we do have control. we pass a budget every year, but the process doesn't always lend itself to taking the deep dive that we really need to where we need to, throughout the year. right, we we look at it, we scrutinize it, we do the best we can to digest a lot of information over a short amount of time and have conversations throughout the year. but the conversations throughout the year are piecemeal contracts coming to us without about an understanding of how they fit into a greater whole. So I'm really looking forward to holding more of these types of hearings, not just on ACFRA, not just as it relates to the Comptroller's Office, but looking forward to the quarterly report, the results of and sort of the answers to the questions that many of us have raised. and then, you know, perhaps having a non-November- December almost- budget hearing on as we dig into various departments and getting questions answered from the department heads themselves, Not just a budgeting issue but a management issue, right, And if we have questions for them, getting answers directly from them about how they are viewing their management role through the lens of saving the city money or growing our revenue sources too, Because I think it has to be for the next two years, until we retire some of our big debt, until a reassessment happens- a lot out of our control, until tariffs stabilize or whatever might happen there. we have to take, I think, we all. it has to be everyone's job, not just OMB, not just the controller's office, not just finance. It has to be all of our jobs to view the decisions we make through the lens of financial and fiscal responsibility. So that's what I aim to do here. I'm so grateful to everyone for their participation and I'm really grateful to the council members who are here for their great questions and helping to daylight again the conversations we've had at the financial task force and at even some of the council and mayor's office leadership meetings as well. So, thank you, there's more to come And with that, having exhausted the business of this post-agenda hearing, this meeting is adjourned. Thank you.
