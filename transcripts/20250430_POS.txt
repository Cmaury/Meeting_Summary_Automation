Good afternoon and welcome to Pittsburgh City Council's cablecast post agenda on the Oakland Business Improvement District, or OBID, for April 30th 2025. And, for the record, we are joined today by Councilmember Bob Sharland, and others might join us as the meeting proceeds And I want to welcome our guests from the Oakland Business Improvement District. Thank you for coming down and for all the work that you do every day. I will turn it over very quickly, but just to provide some context For the reason for the timing of this and why this hearing, why now? there could be a lot of different reasons. I would say that the logistical reason is traditionally we have had both OBID and the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership- both of the bids that have a financial connection to the city and to city finances- present during our budget hearing season, which, looking at our calendar and putting our calendar last December together, We discovered- and it wasn't a new discovery, but it was a new realization- at just how packed that schedule is then and because of that maybe we don't get the same sort of participation or same kind of interest from councilmembers. and even if we do have councilmembers present, their minds are all over the place because of all the days of hearings that we're going through. so why not, if we're going to have a hearing, hold it at a different time of year when we can be a little bit more present? Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, more present mentally and physically. And so that's the rescheduling for today. But you know, I think the other, the other obvious reason is Oakland is still, I believe, unless it's changed in the last couple of years, if it were its own city, it would be the third largest downtown in Pennsylvania. So it's like it's a twin city within a city And there's an incredible amount of work happening right now. You, you take a walk, a bike, a roll, a drive through and you see massive amounts of construction, which we know we were just talking as a little bit of inconvenience, but it means a lot's happening. There's a lot of. it's a center of commerce And there have been some change, some changes in the staffing and the personnel at at the O-Bid. So I think it's it's way well past our time for hearing a little bit more about what's happening in Oakland, what O-Bid's been up to, your vision for the future, and kind of an update for everyone to hear how things are going. So with that, I'm happy to turn it over to our invited guests If you would like to introduce yourself and then anything that you'd like to share with us before we get into some Q&A. Hi, my name is Sean Fertitta and I just thank council for inviting us here today, and I really appreciate that. I am the interim executive director of the Oakland Business Improvement District and I am here supported by my colleague, Kelly McBroom, who's our director of operations. So, like I said, it's an honor to speak before you today. O-Bid plays a vital role in strengthening our community and supporting the businesses and stakeholders that make Oakland so dynamic. For 25 years, O-Bid has been at the heart of Oakland, working tirelessly to create a thriving, clean and safe environment, Leading the charge of that work over the last 20 years, my predecessor, Georgia Petropoulos, has been instrumental in being a community leader and I thank each of you for the proclamation that you awarded her. We serve 250 property and business owners and we maintain nearly five miles of sidewalks and alleys. We are a community of people who are committed to the work that we do. During 2024, we planted over 300 flowers and we have accomplishments to be part of trying to reduce garbage pollution. Our ambassadors have removed over 15 tons of trash and cleaned up 700 pieces of graffiti, and our outdoor dining program saw over 300,000 visits. O-Bid's working with our community to keep our district clean and safe and vibrant for everyone. Since the installation of the outdoor dining areas during COVID, over 60 restaurants have increased their capacity by more than 250 seats, driving significant revenue growth and job creation. For example, Stacked saw a 32% increase in sales, creating four full-time jobs and eight part-time jobs, while Viva Los Tacos experienced a 27% sales boost, leading to nine new jobs. This investment in infrastructure directly benefits our small businesses and enhances the overall experience for employees, students, residents and visitors alike. OBID's impact extends beyond the streets. We experienced significant growth in social media engagement last year, with a newsletter open rate of 46%, which is well above national average. Through social media influencers and social media influencers and promotional campaigns, our marketing efforts drove traffic to the district, contributing to nearly 20 million visits in Oakland in 2024, with 8 million of those visits just to our district alone. Events like Glowland, the Mindful Mile, I Love Pitt Day brought thousands of people into Oakland and created meaningful connections in the city. But perhaps most importantly, OBID is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive community of people and a more inclusive business environment. Through Argyle Studio, OBID is supporting emerging entrepreneurs, especially those from under-representative communities, by removing barriers and providing resources to help them succeed. Take Nabukindu Skincare. So this is a husband and wife team that started in Argyle Studio and they learned about product research distribution. they fine-tuned their marketing. They've since opened a storefront in Robinson DC and they've been a part of the business. They've been a part of the business. They've been a part of the business. They've been a part of the business. They've been a part of the business And they're opening three locations in Africa. So in this next phase of Argyle Studio, this project, we'll be working with property owners to identify ways to attract and retain these local businesses. This work cannot be done without the tireless support of our board of directors, funding support from our property owners, grants and organizations like DCED and the URA, and our generous sponsors And our generous sponsors. Out of the 1. 3 million budget in 2024, 43% was used to keep our district clean and safe, 21% was used for economic development and 36% was used for administration. Oakland is more than just a business district. It's a hub of innovation, culture and community. OBID is proud to work with our partners, including Carlow, CMU, Innovate Pittsburgh, OPDC, OTMA, UPMC- that's a lot of letters- and the University of Pittsburgh, Oakland's cultural institutions and, of course, all of our elected officials Right, Ensuring that Oakland remains one of the most desirable and vibrant economic centers in Pennsylvania. Together, we're building a stronger, more connected future for everyone who lives, works and visits our community. So, thank you, Thank you. Well, I really appreciate it. Thank you. I really appreciate that beautiful kind of summary of everything that's happening in Oakland. We don't have a presentation, so therefore, I will be happy to open this up to our council members that are joining us today. Councilperson Charland, you have a significant portion, as well as being a board member, of OBID. you have a significant portion of Oakland that interacts with, and is covered by, the geographic area of OBID. So, please, any comments or questions that you have. Yeah, No, I'm glad you guys are here, and I think this is a good way to do this, instead of having you come during the budget briefing season, where we're all kind of slammed and our minds are a bunch of different places. I think you know this is a wise way to do this. You know I Well, it is very cool for me to be able to be part of the budget briefing season. It's been a great time for me and I want to thank all of you guys so much. Thank you so much. It's been a great time. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. I'm, I'm The. Especially the Forbes business district, you know, is constantly evolving And I think that's the thing that an organization like OBID is able to help with. We're in the process in the South side of looking at possibly creating a bit of our own. you know, a woman's-based business, carson street, and we've talked a lot about managed communities versus unmanaged communities and how important that is. you know, you wouldn't? the oxford building is the is, you know, a great example of like. this is a managed building. this is the same square footage as east carson street and yet east carson street doesn't have management. it's just, you know. however, we handle that. i guess what i- what i want to start off talking about- is, like, what are, how are you seeing in the evolution of the street? how are you seeing the, the business district, change right now, post-covid, as we're trying to figure out where, like, what, the next steps are forward for a lot of our retail spaces, what, what, how are you seeing that evolve. well, sure, so i mean, as council person strassberger mentioned right, oakland is under an enormous amount of development right now, and so we are really fortunate. it's a lovely problem to have with that. we have to grow with it. so it just means that our services, as a bid, actually has to keep up with that. so keeping a clean and safe district is instrumental in bringing businesses to oakland and keeping them there. so things that we are currently working on is knowing that there's going to be so many more businesses in the area so we're not seeing a lot of people coming in with this development. You know, Kelly, again our Director of Operations, has been really kind of cleaning up our sidewalks, eliminating some of the obstacles that are in the way, just to make more room for people and anyone with strollers or using wheelchairs or whatever their mobility needs may be, just trying to make as much room for everyone as possible. We're also again working with our business owners, our retail managers, through a stakeholder engagement committee, trying to actually go through and actually hear what they need to be successful. And so I'm really excited for that piece, because we can come to the table with as many ideas as we want, but unless we're actually benefiting our businesses, then we're still missing the mark. So the power of listening is hugely important. And then recognizing that our students are- seasonal, dare I say, And if we, we've got to just recognize that Oakland is a community and there's a lot of people who passionately live there and we are there to serve them as well. So if we're all working together, I think that that's the goal right. So you know, as more people move in, then the neighbors thrive, our businesses thrive, they stay open. So I I see it, I see us all working together as the future of Oakland. So one thing I kind of want to narrow down on: the business district has a lot of places to eat, a lot of restaurant and dining. It's not like a senior high school and all the dining. And I know that it's always been a stated desire to figure out how do we get effective lab space, effective office space that can be kind of those, those spinoffs, those roll-offs of the university, especially in the, the kind of for-profit space so we can tax them? What, how is that going Where? what were your thoughts on that? Where? where do we stand right here in April of 2025? Sure, so Oakland is part of the innovation district and you know, Innovate Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Innovation District again deal directly with those technology companies And we are there in a capacity that we support all businesses in the district. But what I have heard is that Oakland's a little short on large lab space like just the real estate alone. We don't have the square footage available to these companies And so really trying to tackle that, So we are really concentrated on the ground floor businesses. but again, when those tech companies move in because we have such incredible universities around that they can pull that talent from. again, it's about keeping people there And from there. when there's that thriving community, then our business owners thrive. Yeah, I mean, I think that's crucially important. that kind of that. it helps raise the prestige of our universities. It also helps build up the daytime business economy because everyone that works there has something to eat, they have something to do somewhere. but also it creates this whole level of synergy in the district, this vibrancy, And I know that there are challenges there, especially when we did the Oakland plan, a lot of these decisions were made in a pre-pandemic world And now we're like how do we fill space And how do we make sure that the space is the right space, Because going to work means very different things for a lot of people now. So that's obviously gonna be something. I really wanna continue to see what we're doing with that, how we're moving forward there, One kind of in the specific or in the nitty gritty. I know that last year- yeah, it was last year- well, we on the OBID board we looked at a cohort reducing- or we had to reduce- the millage rate because we were overfunded at that point from what we're allowed to what we were authorized to take. where where do we stand now? and start as far as the financials of a bit. sure, I would love to say that we're overfunded. that is sadly not the case. so in our bylaws and in the resolution that we have with the city of Pittsburgh, there is a millage rate and then there is a not to exceed amount and with that, historically again. so I took over from my predecessor, Georgia Petropolis. so I've been in this role since September. but for me, going back and looking through, I've not seen a millage rate higher than three point seven and our max is four point five. okay, so I'm not sure if that's true, but I think that's true. I think that's true. so with that, you know, through our budget process, you know, very similar to yours- we got to figure out what our core services are. we have to figure out what developments are coming into. Oakland, you know, when a building gets demolished to make room for something new, there's actually we lose revenue for that for the building for however long that they're in construction. so taking all of that into effect or into- yeah, taking all that into, into, into, into, into, into, into into mind, and then thinking about what our stakeholders are basically willing to pay for these services, all of that kind of feeds into it. so it's a little bit of an art and a science, and so we have not actually maxed out our millage. and this past year we were also maybe a little late in doing in our budget cycle, and so we knew that the economy might have been a little bit more in the way of the budget cycle, and so we knew that the economy might have been a little bit more in the way of the budget cycle, and so we knew that the economy might might be a little questionable and so uncertain at times. so we actually decided, thanks to an amazing passionate board, that we were going to keep the millage rate the same. so for two years in a row we've been at 3. 54 and before that we were at 3. 7. so we did lower it two years ago and that was based on the amount of development coming in. again, when all of that developments coming in, we collect the authority and we collect the. the authority and we collect the. eventually is all pork paid for to the making sure actually see the benefit of that. And then really, the last question I have, and I might have a couple more as we talk more, but what are you most excited about through the summer and through the end of the year here? For me I don't. we light up every time we get out into the district and we get to talk to the people working behind the counters, to the property and business owners, just to the people in the street, just to see how they're enjoying their neighborhood, And so I love the people aspect of it. So, and I believe, Kelly, you would agree, it's something that you've expressed your interest as well, But as far as that it's really it's bringing people together, It's bringing departments of the city together with, you know, PennDOT, with every like to really kind of solve some of these issues that we're having in Oakland as we grow, as development is coming in. You know, pre-meeting here, we were talking about creating space for more loading zones. right, Because we have, let's be real, we've got a double parking issue, especially along Forbes Avenue, with all of our delivery drivers- And I'm very thankful to, you know, all of our. you know we've got a lot of parking issues. We've got a lot of parking issues with the to all of our DoorDash and Uber Eats folks, but we've got to find a place for them and not in the middle of Forbes Avenue. So, you know, I love pulling people to the table and having those discussions. I want to have more discussions with, you know, our property owners and all chains, right? So these are the things that I'm really looking forward to tackling this year and in the foreseeable future. All right, so I thought that was my last one, but I didn't want to let everyone heat up. Go ahead. The BRT is coming And you're exactly right. The transportation plan of Oakland: you know, I've often joked that like it's like hitting the jackpot. if you can get down Forbes and if you hit the timing right and there's no construction, you absolutely can do green lights all the way through. but it doesn't happen very often anymore now that you know, and it definitely doesn't happen if there's a FedEx truck in front of FedEx. But you know, I guess that's a whole nother discussion. That's up to you. But how are you preparing? I'm preparing for when the BRT is running, there's going to be a whole lot of people that are going to be spending at least a small portion of time in Oakland. What's the preparation? to make sure that when people are hitting their transfers in Oakland, that this is a place that they stop and, you know, spend a couple of dollars, or that this is a place that they want to have a meeting, you know, or to go to happy hour or whatever, that they're going to be able to get a job, you know that's what the plan might be, Sure, So I can't wait for that to happen. right, Having that direct connection from here- the Hill District, you know- to downtown, you know it's an amazing service and I hope people take advantage of it. We do have these incredibly nice stations coming in, So right, first and foremost, first and foremost, it's like working with our partners to make sure that you know we're not just a small group of people that are going to be spending a lot of money and we're going to be able to get a job. So I really want to make sure that we are partners at the table for that. There are opportunities as a part of that project for public art, and so I think having public art in that space is going to attract people. I believe having these clean, well-kept sidewalks will make it really enjoyable for people and it's up to us, as far as sort of a marketing and promotions, you know, agency, I think that's a good thing. We're a really good agency that we are working with our stakeholders, working with those businesses and promoting things like Restaurant Week. You know what we used to call Taste of Oakland. we're now calling the Flavor Walk, where we're partnering restaurants with retail space and so you can go into, let's say, Argyle Studio and have a little nibble from Stacked Burger, And so we're trying to partner folks. So having these sort of activities, promotions throughout, I think, is gonna be great to have that. But also we have the outdoor dining platforms That brings, like I said, over 300,000 people just last year used those platforms. We have the flowers, you know, making it pretty. People want to be in a space where they feel good, and so I think really it's up to us just to keep doing what we're doing plus and finding those opportunities to create space where just people want to be. Thank you, Thank you, Councilperson, So I'll add some notes here. Can you speak a little more about the ways that OBID can deploy its economic development budget? What does that look like for OBID? Sure, so right. for me, economic development is sort of multifaceted, So mainly my first priority is to keep our existing businesses open And connecting them to resources that are already out there that people may not know. So you know, being an educator in that realm. So even just yesterday, the URA in the neighborhood was a lovely program that we got to partner on, And so where the URA got to come around and we split up amongst teams and we introduced the URA- And so we're a very big URA- to our businesses. So you need to make improvements, you want to expand, you need equipment, like these are your options. So we need to do more of this education. We need to continue to support new entrepreneurs, right, And so, again, we did a retail strategy with ULEAD. It's a consulting agency- And they identified some major barriers. Again, the cost of commercial real estate is one of them. So, again, pulling people together and figuring out how to, you know, reduce some of these barriers, And we'll. you know, Argyle Studio is doing great And it was lovely to see Representative Frankel in there yesterday And he just had a great time- And seeing people light up when they walk into that space for the first time, it's really, it's a wonderful experience. So, again, training and education. Working with your Office of Nighttime Accountants, We're working with the Department of Economy on providing education for our businesses. We're also working with we've got a new partnership with PAR and the University of Pittsburgh on harassment and bystander training. So that would be great for the south side as well. So, yeah, we're just trying to come up. we're working with the IEE, the Institute for Entrepreneurial Excellence, and funneling some of our new entrepreneurs through there. Working with our financial institutions for financial literacy. So we're really just trying to connect people to all of these amazing services that are out there that just no one knows about. Of course, the infrastructure: we've got the- I talked about the sidewalks, but we've also got the new pedestrian wayfinding signage that's going in, So that's a lovely addition for us I would love to work to, and you're talking about the tech companies. I would love to continue to work on what you know, what connectors we can make to those other communities to make Pittsburgh and that tech community feel even smaller, right, So we're more connected And really just being community focused, like I've been saying all along and, like you know, just realizing that we don't work in a vacuum. So I think all of that in total, you know, as long as we are listening to our stakeholders and really providing those core services and just listening And bringing people together, I think that's what's really going to create this a thriving district, Thank you. So convening infrastructure- but like the convening part, the connecting part is a really big theme. So, and sometimes it takes money and sometimes it doesn't, It's just, you know, the human resources and that time that it takes to cultivate relationships, to be a hub. Mm-hmm. You mentioned the street region Mm-hmm And street reese program And I have to say OBID was an incredible resource to our office during the early days of the pandemic, in the first year or two, when no other business district, many other business districts, particularly those that aren't as kind of well organized- had a model for street reese and for getting their restaurants outside and bringing customers back in. So I have to mention it before at this table, but I have to thank you all again for the resources that you provided our office, like basically just pro bono, to say this is how we made it happen and these are the steps we took, and here's what you do and here's how you think about it, whether it was, you know, full closures of streets, like on oakland avenue, or streeteries, so that's been a that's been a model for other streets as well. well, i will also add to that kudos to everyone here and working in this building who listened and who, like we just know we need to do this for our businesses, for them to thrive, and we're going to like figure it out as we go along. so that flexibility i truly appreciate. there was a lot of building the plane as they were flying it for sure, which is, yeah, credit to everyone at domey and others to help make that happen and to ensure that they were also safe and, you know, accessible and everything do you have. do you know of any plans to expand streeteries in other parts of the district? well, that comes back to, dare i say, you know, real estate issue. there's not a lot of of open space right now. so i'm not- i'm not opposed because they work so well, but i think i would love to sort of tackle some of these sort of double parking delivery issues. and if that space is, is Adiker used for kind of small the good, that's a bad bang. emy spotter lantern flies like we're finally going to have a summer where we can. i know, please, please, use our street aries in peace, right, thank you for that, and that makes sense. i mean there's a lot of. there are a lot of different possible uses for curb space and not every single one can be a street area. i understand that. generally speaking, what would you recommend to business districts who are considering bid status? are there certain corridors that lend themselves better than others, or certain sets of corridors that are adjacent to one another? sure, i mean right, these, these bids work really well in highly concentrated areas of businesses. you know it, when there is such a high concentration that it requires a level of service that one agency alone can't maintain. so if you've got a really high concentrated area of businesses and everyone is in support of it, again it goes back to this: building relationships, because if people don't want it, you're not going to get a foothold. so and then once you do have it, once you convince everybody, it's keeping those relationships going so they continue to see the future, and i think that's a really important thing to do. and i think that's a really important thing to do, and i think that's a really important thing to do and, i think, see results and they continue to see value in the process. so i know i keep coming back to connection, but that's really been what we've been doing since we came on board in september is really just getting out, meeting people, seeing what has worked, what hasn't worked, and it's a lot, it's a lot of relationship building. and then, once you have those relationships, it's about maintaining them and i i can't tell you how important that is for the community and for the community and for the community and for the, for the community and for the, for people who are considering. you know, starting a bid is like once for people who are considering. you know, starting a bid is like once you, once you have the documents and you, once you have the documents and everything is signed and sealed, that's when the work begins right, it's you've got to put the, the programs in place. you have got to show that you're doing the work and you need to keep listening and evolving with what's going on, because those stakeholders are there in the trenches. they're the ones who are trying to keep their lights on and and keep people fed and whatever it is, And I'm there to support them And so just whatever I can do to help them out. that's what we're gonna do. Those are our priorities. That's great, thank you. I can't let the meeting go without this hearing go, without putting in a plug for what I am hearing on the street is what various- I don't know, I wouldn't call them business stakeholders- They're consumers- are asking for, which I don't think is a shock here. One is, with all the closures of- and there's new places coming in, but closures of some of the longer serving institutions, a place where faculty and staff of our institutions can get happy hour. that is different from where their students go. That's something they're asking for. So that's sort of interesting. We have weekly conversations with people- I'm sure you do, I'm sure you do- And the other, as you know, is it's been a conversation with OBID, it's been a conversation with OPDC, it's been a conversation with a number of different partners, but those gathering spots that don't involve alcohol or are 18 and over music venues- the music venue, I think, is a big part of it, but even other types of more flexible gathering spots that are coffee shops, that are places that don't involve necessarily a bar or needing an ID to get in. So those are the two big ones that I hear about and I know you're laser focused on whatever power you have to attract that kind of business as well. Yes, thank you. Yeah, again, it's us pulling those landlords together and figuring out how we can best serve the community, all community, Yeah, everybody, exactly Anything further. Councilperson Charlin, No, I just you know, I'm glad to have you know, I'm glad to have you as individuals here. I'm also very glad to have OBID in the district. you know, Coming back to like the conversations about the pandemic and how and post pandemic, the bid was just able to be both of our bids, the PDP and OBID, which you know you guys are very different but also able to fill very similar roles and just being more nimble than government can be, And we're very fortunate to have you. you know, as you saw when we went to Dallas, the, you know, the areas like Deep Ellum were able to be more nimble than the city of Dallas as a whole. and you know- and I just I think of that constantly- that like how lucky we are to have organizations like OBID to help manage you know, the. we don't know what the next challenge is going to be, but whatever that is, you know your flexibility and your ability to pivot there. So, just, you know, very thankful for our relationship, Yeah, and we couldn't obviously do it without the support of you either. So, you know, again, it's just, it's everybody working together. and a shout out to Jeremy and the Downtown Partnership. Jeremy's been a huge help to me in my transition And so I'm really thankful for that. And I think there's a definite opportunity, as more BIDs come online, that we are all here to support each other, you know, as an entire city, as a, as a, dare I say, a one big business improvement district. so, Thank you, thank you, Thank you, Thank you, thank you- and I'll just echo the thanks- and for the work that you and your team do every day. It really is invaluable and, you know, demonstrates what we can do when we have creative. Yeah, great work and really is invaluable and, you know, demonstrates what we can do when we have creative of structures, like bids to augment the work that the city already does. City can't be everywhere, city can't do everything, especially cities like Pittsburgh. so really appreciate the work you do every day And thank you for your time this afternoon. Was there any closing thoughts? anything else you'd like to say that you haven't already? No, just I really appreciate the opportunity and I look forward to continuing the work. Excellent, we look forward to that as well. Well, with that, we've exhausted the business of this post-agenda. I will adjourn this meeting. Thank you, Thank you.
