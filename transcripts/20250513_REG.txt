Good morning and welcome to the regular meeting of City Council on Tuesday, May 13, 2025. Mr Sharland Here, Mr Coghill Here, Ms Gross. Now you all come rolling in. Mr Mosley Here, Mrs Kale-Smith, Here Mrs Strasberger, Here Mrs Warwick, Here Mr Wilson, Here Mr Lavelle, President Here, seven members present, just for the record. councilman gross is also here. there's a nationwide issue with zoom this morning, so we're having problems managing getting people in and out of it. but i'm texting with her back and forth, so she is here with that. we actually need a motion to waive the rules of council, so moved second. all those in favor say aye, aye, the rules have been waived. and now, for all those that are able, please rise for the pledge of allegiance. remain standing for a moment of silence. thank you. our next order business is to amend the agenda. is there a motion to amend? to move second. all those in favor say aye, the agenda has been amended. our next order business is proclamations. councilman Smith is not here, so we'll move into those that he read into the record. we have one by councilman Strasburg. council person Strasburger presents. be it further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby declare May 16th 2025 to be the day of sustainability and environmental justice in the city of Pittsburgh. maybe have a motion to approve? so move. the second proclamation has been approved. we also have a will of counsel from Councilman Warwick. oh, sure, thanks, it's for a minimum wage. yeah, do you want to read it? or? yeah, sure, in its entirety. yeah, please, thank you. councilman Warwick presents: whereas it has been 15 years since Pennsylvania last raised its minimum wage to $7. 25, and whereas every dollar earned for a worker today is worth a full 51% less than it was in 2006. and whereas 32 states and Washington DC have increased their minimum wage, including every state that borders Pennsylvania. and whereas Governor Shapiro has called for the statewide minimum wage to increase to $15. And whereas 1. 3 million Pennsylvania workers would benefit from a $15 per hour minimum wage. And whereas, while positive trends in job and wage growth are contributing to a strong and dynamic local economy in Pittsburgh, they are also placing upward pressure on prices, particularly for housing. and whereas empowering Pittsburgh to establish our own minimum wage policies would allow us to ensure that wage scales in our city reflect the economic realities that our residents face, prevent displacement and brain drain, encourage population growth within the city and help to secure critical workforce pipelines for our growing industries. And whereas, by calling for an increased wage, Pittsburgh is joining municipalities across the Commonwealth, including Philadelphia, Allentown and the City of Lancaster, which have passed resolutions in support of HB 1150. Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh hereby urges the Pennsylvania General Assembly to pass Representative Ronnie Green's legislation, HB 1150, to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. and be it further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh urges that any minimum wage legislation include an annual cost of living adjustment and grants municipalities local wage freedom by lifting state preemption on wages. and be it further resolved that a copy of this will of council will be distributed to the Allegheny County Delegations of the Pennsylvania State General Assembly and and to the office of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. May we have a motion to approve So moved. Second, Any discussion? Councilwoman Warburg. Yeah, so I just, you know, as far as the minimum wage goes. you know, every year I go to Alderdice and I talk to the seniors just about workforce development stuff And one of the first things that I ask them is who's working right, and most of them are, and I ask them how much they're making And I let them know that in this economy, no one should be making less than $15 an hour, right? So, minimum wage rules or not, And a lot of them are, And some of them are making as little as 10 something an hour. Some of them are making like almost 15 an hour. So I really feel like anybody who is paying less than $15 an hour right now- and I don't care who, you are right, Whether you're a small business owner or a giant corporation, or hiring a babysitter or hiring someone to do your lot like $15- if you're not paying at least at least $15 an hour in this economy, You are exploiting the person who is working for you. So you know this. and, of course, the fact that the minimum wage is seven something an hour in Pennsylvania. it's, you know, it's laughable, right? But the problem is that that enables that exploitation, right, By having such a low minimum wage. that enables you know businesses to. you know, when that 15 year old comes in looking for, you know, looking for- a job, it enables them to pay them that 11 dollars just because they don't know, right, maybe that they just don't realize what they should be making because they're just not as savvy, or if that's, you know, maybe someone, a, a newer immigrant to the, to the city, or something like that, just someone who isn't as savvy about what they should be making right or what that job should be paying, because they just don't have that kind of experience. so yeah, that's all. I'm just this. this seems like such a no-brainer to me, but I don't know, we'll see. we'll see what happens. so, thank you. thank you very much. any further discussion seeing none. all those in favor say aye, aye, aye. the will of council has been approved. so that will take us to public comment. council president, we, councilman Caldwell and I, are going to do the proc for council. mikhail smith, i apologize, i didn't realize that either, did i? all right, oh, trace, i saw you on the other way. all right, i get to to pitch hit here for council mikhail smith for a very important issue here. so whereas motorcycle awareness month is the annual campaign to increase awareness of motorcycles on the open road and advocate for measures that improve the safety of riders on our nation's roads and highways, and whereas motorcycle riding is a popular form of recreation and transportation for thousands of people across pittsburgh in the commonwealth, the safety of all pittsburgh motorists is an issue of utmost consequence and all motorists should unite in the safe sharing of the city of pittsburgh's roadways. and whereas more than 800 875 thousands licensed motor motorcyclists are required to keep their vehicles inspected and obey current laws relative to the operator, safety and equipment. whereas, in efforts to reduce the number of motorcycle crashes and fatalities, the pennsylvania department of transportation and the city of pittsburgh encourages all motorists to avoid becoming another crash statistic and take advantage of the free training courses offered through the pennsylvania motorcycle safety program. and whereas it is especially significant that citizens of the the city of pittsburgh be aware of motorcyclists on the streets and highways and recognize the importance of staying alert, practicing safe driving techniques and promoting motorcycle safety. and whereas, during the month of may, the city of pittsburgh and the alliance of bikers aimed toward education, a bait, a pittsburgh of pennsylvania's, pennsylvania's allegheny county chapter, will continue their advocacy of motorcycle safety. and whereas the city of pittsburgh encourages all motorcyclists to continue their efforts to promote safety and motorcycle awareness and all drivers to respect the unique safety needs of of motorcycles. and now, therefore, be it resolved that the council of the city of pittsburgh does hereby commend a bait for the efforts in teaching motorcycle safety and awareness and be it further resolved that the council of the city of pittsburgh does hereby declare may 2025 to be motorcycle safety awareness month. in the city of pittsburgh, we have a motion to approve. second, all those in favor say aye, aye, congratulations. thank you, councilman charlotte. he, he doesn't have a motorcycle, but he had a mini bike when he was younger. i don't know that, so now i just want to thank you all for coming down. i know i don't see timmy here, but i'm glad to see a couple new faces as well. i no longer have my sign, if you have them- i don't know if you have some on you- they look a little ragged, like we're. we're gonna have to make an investment, right, so but? but i put one in my yard, so it's good just to bring awareness for the month and appreciate you being here and speaking the devil who walked in, our former president, councilwoman theresa keelsmith. so i just want to thank you all for all that you do. i just i don't know if you realize, but dwayne works for animal care and control, and so i want to thank him. he's a resident of sheridan and his wife is here as well, and they do amazing stuff. i actually coached their daughters in cheerleading and he got out on the field with them one day. so but i'll just say that real quickly, that my son is a writer. he's a police officer and a writer in another state and i'm all i was always worried about him riding the riding, but i'm more worried about me driving behind him. so, councilwoman warwick, yeah, i just want to say you know i i love having you all here every year and you know i'm i love coalitions and, of course, you know I don't ride a motorcycle but I ride a bicycle and it's, you know, it's the same issue. It's the same issue with pedestrians in our streets. It's the same issue with cyclists and folks in. you know they're in their cars, they're on their phones, they're not paying attention, and the other thing- and I'm sure that you feel the same frustration- is a lot of times I hear sort of blaming the cyclist or the biker, right, Like oh well, they don't do, and it's like: look it's. everybody makes mistakes, right, everybody right, and we need to be looking out for each other on the road. the road does not belong just to to folks in cars, right, it belongs to all of us, no matter. no matter how we're walking or rolling through our streets. so i would love to see that coalition with the cyclists. that would be a fun press conference, i'm sure. i'm sure you'd love that, but thank you. all members want to come up, is that okay? sure, duane? i'm sorry, did you want to say a few words first? i usually don't give him a mic, but, tracy, you remember when he was cheerleading, right? yeah, yeah, i also spent like almost 20 years with another person there coaching the girls softball team in elliott over that way, so they kind of grew up. i'd like to thank Council President for having us. Teresa for doing this. I am the Chapter President newly elected this year. John on the end right here, he's our former. he was here last year. I replaced him as the President. He had what? 10 years and he wanted to take a break to where he gets to sit in the background there and cause me problems. now, Michelle, she's my secretary. Dave Harris: he's a former membership officer. And then I have Rick here. He's my product offers. He also was a treasurer. I'm also a district rep. I Serve Southwestern Pennsylvania or six other chapters in our district, including our chapter abate. I'm kind of reading off some stuff here because I'm not good at speaking that well. A beta Pennsylvania is an organization of motorcyclists dedicated to the protection of individual rights of motorcycles through political change, public education In charitable works. as part of our mission, We are also active in eliminating unfair legislation as it concerns motorcyclists, promoting motorcycle safety through Bay, both motorist and rider education, and proving the the the to the public. a Couple of the things here that I'm basically reading off our flyer here: the license plates we were responsible in getting successfully passed in the state. the obtaining vanity- veterans are collectible and disabled vertical plates for motorcycles. the rider education- it's a big thing. all riders need to understand what the rules are on the road. we ride out there a lot and motorcycles have to ride with their heads on a swivel. A lot of people get used to the winter months in their cars. They drive around and things like that, And next thing, you know bikes are out on the road and everybody kind of forgets they're there, including your bicycles. So that's an important thing. The penalties we have passed were successfully passed: a provision that increases the penalties for careless driving offenses that kills or seriously injures people. There's a few laws out there- daniel's law, that- that law there was passed back in 2016, which is a big law, and there's a new law that's coming out. it's called the miller's law- basically is it, but it's been enhanced- that enhances penalties for accidents caused by texting while driving resulting in serious bodily injury. the new one that's coming out now is the miller's law and this is the one that they're working to get it that get activated. it has been passed by governor shapiro. what this entails is is handheld devices. now, eventually, it's going to be to the point. some people like it, some people don't, but state police and other police departments will be able to pull you over now if you have a handheld device. in your last year in pennsylvania, it was 8 200- or, yeah, 8 200- motorcyclists killed in pennsylvania. there's also 875 000 licensed motorcyclists in pennsylvania, so it's real important and i appreciate council giving us this proclamation again. mr president, theresa, that's pretty much all i have, but thank you very much and god bless. thank you. and when you talk about partnerships, you know, what i'd like to see is for us to do something with our magistrates when kids get pulled over for racing with their little motorcycles all around the city. if they would have to participate in one of your educational classes. i mean, i think maybe we could work that out somehow. so thank you. all members want to come forward. thank you, i can never keep so. our next order of business will be public comment. i would like to remind everyone that the rules of council state that comments are limited to matters of concern, official action or liberation, which may be before city council. profanity will not be permitted. after you recall, please restate your name, provide your neighborhood for the record. you'll be given three minutes to speak. our first registered speaker is dr ronald miller. dr ronald miller, oakland, toronto, canada. american chemical society, the linguistic society of america, the association sociological Association of America and the Asian Studies Association. early 2000s I became a member. the q5 info Intel framework is copyright by me.

I thought that the vote on the vegetation height ordinance was going on today, but it's just as well, So I'm gonna cut this short, If y'all will please read written testimony. that's coming. I'm Ed Renamdy from Swissville. I mean Swiss Elm Park, excuse me. So I sincerely appreciate the intent behind the amendment of the brief city code section about vegetation, aka noxious weed height, and thanks to Council Member Barb Warwick for being the primary sponsor, and I'd hope to speak with you before it comes up for a vote. However, after much thought, I now favor reconsidering this so that we'll have more time to work on a more comprehensive legislation that I would like to see passed later this year, no matter the vote on the amendment. Such a plan should rely primarily on education and support to encourage voluntary, beneficial changes. It would allow cooperation from our chapter of wild ones and the Pennsylvania native plant society. as I had mentioned before, both have sample ordinances. FIPS would be a great partner, as is the Audubon Society already. please contact me if you would like my help in bringing together expertise and I'll cut it off at this. please read the written testimony, thank you. thank you very much. that exhausts our list of registered speakers. will now take comments from those in chambers. if you're wishing to speak, please come forward at this time. provide your name and neighborhood for the record. you'll be given three minutes to speak. good morning, sorry, i'm late. my name is devin mclean. i grew up on the hill district, cliff street, befford avenue, francis court, off of wally. i like this thing you're doing with the lineup so i can actually see your faces. september 13th, friday, 2024. i was working a shift as a security guard out there where second avenue turns into greenfield avenue, you get on the eliza furnace trail right there. if you look at the trailhead, there's one of them things that the gas company does, with all valves sticking out and it's a fence around it. no smoking lights or open flame- i don't know what those are called, but a pump station. I'm gonna say for the sake of this situation. I was working a shift on a UPMC lot when at about 10: 30 pm I seen a guy walking- but I always see guys walking, you know, even though it's after dark and the trail closes after dark. I seen him walking and then boom, a 10-foot circle of lingering white smoke. This dude just set off a stick of dynamite. Now, had that explosion been about eight feet to the right, my co-worker who was in the security booth could have been seriously, fatally injured or jacked up if the glass broken went into her face. So I flashed a guy with my flashlight. Hey, you stop. Hey you stop. You there with the goatee. You there in the long hair, You there in the shorts. He didn't turn around until I started using racial epithets at him. What are you doing? What's your problem? Do you know where you're at?

I said Jamaica. and then, And there was a young Jamaican fellow sitting there and he asked me where had I been? Well, my daughter goes all the time, I know. I went to Kingston and a lot of little villages, But I said, sir, I said, if you're from Jamaica, you know it's a mountain, a tall mountain that we went to And I believe it's in Kingston, And as you go up the walkway there's a statue.

Sheridan needs some attention for the kids, but Esplin also needs some attention to for some of the things they have. it's a small area and it borders McKees rocks. a lot of people want to climb over Esplin here to get to the Sheridan part or go over to McKees rocks and I just want to make sure that. but that's always on somebody's radar. That's it, thank you. They're waiting for a new playground there, that's all, Thank you. Thank you, I've got Councilman Gross and Councilman Strasburger. I appreciate Councilwoman Smith thanking our Parks and Rec Department and it makes me remember how hard she and I fought to raise the wages for lifeguards as well as other members, And, as a reminder, it is also recruiting for lifeguard season. so if you're out there and looking for summer employment, the lifeguard wages now range from $17. 48 an hour to $20. 16 an hour- And you go to good tan. we should, too, take that job. It's a great job for people across the city and so we encourage you. that includes if you're not a certified lifeguard. if you can sign up now, you still have the window to have free certification during as part of your training. And there's number on and what I can read. the number allowed its 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 8, which is great news. And while I'm at it, I'm just literally reading from the city parks Twitter feed. So you guys are doing a good job on the app that used to be called Twitter. The call that I often get in my office is: when are the vouchers for seniors being distributed for the farmers market season? and the day I have on my calendar is that the healthy, active living center senior centers across the city. on Tuesday, June 10th, from 9 am to 12 pm they're going to. in the afternoon, from 1 to 3, you can pick up your vouchers for the seat farmers markets. So, thank you, appreciate a reminder that it's pool season again and it's lifeguard season again, and we're grateful to the parks and rec department, thank you. thank you, councilman, thank you. i'd like to make a motion to call for a post agenda hearing on the annual comprehensive financial report. second, all those in favor say aye, aye, any opposed? we'll work with your office and the clerk to get that scheduled. anything else from members? if not? i just want to take two seconds and thank you all for your vote some months ago now on the trade for manchester chateau. i paid attention, you didn't, but the final vote was actually cast by the county last week and they approved it as well. but it started here and made it through the school district. we actually had a community meeting in manchester yesterday about. it focused specifically on housing and how the housing opportunity fund and all the housing, the bond and all of that is spread across the city. but now we have an opportunity to do something specific for that neighborhood. so it was a good and productive meeting. but i want to thank you all for your vote on that and helping move that forward. i saw some other. i just want to say something real quickly about that. i- i you know- always admired how you handle things so calmly and just really a matter of factly. and i watched you in one of those meetings in my office, meeting with people about the farm and some of the things, and you just handled it so professionally and so amazing and i just want to thank you for that, because i think people don't see you behind of scenes and what you do and i think if they had seen that they would have also appreciated how you handled it. so i just want to thank you for that. thank you and congratulate you on getting an adult passion. thank you, councilman. yeah, no, i just wanted to echo councilwoman kale smith's sentiments. i watched them do it in the lower hill, i think for the most part with the those properties there, the sca properties, city properties, ura properties, all that stuff. but but you managed to please, i think for the most part, the lower hill district and i'm glad to see that, with the people from manchester too. i thought they were really great coming in here and, you know, showing that they wanted your attention and you gave it to them. so thanks, thank you. if nothing else, we do have many announcements. this afternoon, at one o'clock, council hold an executive session on bill 1833 as it relates to litigation matters. also tomorrow, wednesday, may 14th, at 10 am, council hold our standing committee meeting. speaker registration closes at 9: 00 am. also tomorrow, at 2 pm, council will hold a cablecast post agenda on the safe passage program shared by councilman warwick. and then, lastly, thursday, may 15th, at 6 pm at the western healthy, active, active living senior center located at 80 wabash street and pittsburgh, pa 15220, council hold a public hearing on public safety and crime in the city of city of pittsburgh. to register to speak at this meeting, which will be in person and there is no virtual option, please fill up the sign up form on the council meeting webpage by the deadline. you also call the clerk's office at 412-255-2138. registration will close at 4 pm, the day of the hearing, which is thursday, may 15th. also, please note that cablecast public hearing for bills night 1698 and 1723 relative to zoning and bakery square, scheduled for this afternoon, have been postponed. i believe. yeah, all members were present. so we need a motion to approve the minutes and adjourn the meeting. so move second. all those in favor say aye, aye, we are adjourned.
