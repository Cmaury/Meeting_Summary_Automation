So, whereas the Neighborhood Academy is a faith-based college-prepatory independent school whose mission is to break the cycle of generational poverty by empowering youth and preparing them for college, it is their belief that all students have access to a high quality education, regardless of a student's background or socioeconomic status. and whereas the hard work and perseverance of the coaches of the neighborhood Academy Bulldogs has led them down a path of hard-fought victory, led by Jordan Marks, head coach, assistant coaches Chris Wazirinsky- close okay- Nick Nick Rivers, Yoni Eglash, Jackson Bloffield, Henry Bloffield- I think I remember Jackson Bloffield from back at the Boys and Girls Club- have worked tirelessly to coach, support and mentor their team to be successful on and off the court. and whereas the neighborhood academies Bulldogs basketball team has an impeccable record of 30 wins and one loss, while accomplishing section championship, with Beale class a state championship- and the PI double-a class a state champions, the championship squad is composed of: Courtney Wallace- I played a lot of basketball with your dad back at Perry- Shamar Simpson, censor Nicholson, junior uno, don't know will be co Kedron Gilmore, Derek Hardiman, chase Brown, DeAndre green, Dante Wright, Khadmir Davis- you serious dribbling- and Dre air Mac. and now, therefore, be it resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby recognize and congratulate the neighborhood Academy for the commitment to hard work, discipline and teamwork, and be a further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does here by declare Tuesday, April 29th 2025, to be neighborhood Academy Bulldogs day in the City of Pittsburgh.

Let's give another round of applause for the Neighborhood Academy And now we'll have Councilman Strasburger. All right, I am pinch-hitting today for Councilwoman Kayle Smith. So can we get Lillia Wirth and her family and supporters and friends up here? Everyone who's with Lillia, please come up. Welcome, welcome. You can stand just to my left, Lila. thank you, Lila Wirth. thank you, Before I read your name. I've read your name like 10 times now. Whereas Lila Wirth came from a small town in central Pennsylvania called Mifflinburg, which I actually know exactly where that is, Her family moved to Pittsburgh in August of 2023. And whereas, since moving to Pittsburgh, Lila has taken the initiative of cleaning up the Eileen McCoy Playground and various streets in Mount Washington and Duquesne Heights. And whereas Lila began picking up trash in September of 2023. but it all started in an unexpected way. At 13 years old, did you get permission to tell this story? She was grounded and her parents came up with a creative form of discipline. They had her clean up in the neighborhood. What started as a consequence quickly transformed into purposeful routine, which turned into something more meaningful. And whereas, after her grounding ended, Lila noticed the growing piles of garbage and that no one was doing anything about it, That realization sparked one of her strongest motivations: She was also driven by a deep concern for the safety of children. And she was also driven by a deep concern for the safety of children and animals near her local park, Dilworth. And whereas determined to make a difference, Lila took matters into her own hands. Once a week, she fills one to two grocery bags with trash, aiming to clean even more streets this year. Though no one has joined her yet, she remains committed to her mission of keeping the community clean. And whereas she now has a sense of pride as people light up when they see her walking down the sidewalk wearing her blue, or sometimes pink, latex gloves, carrying a bag and filling it with trash, Those small steps are the most important steps And those small smiles remind her that small actions can make a big difference. And whereas Lila is currently a freshman attending Pittsburgh Kappa 6-12 studying literary arts, she loves to write and in her spare time she enjoys playing volleyball, boxing, rollerblading, listening to music and making people laugh. Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby recognize and commends Lila Worth for her initiative in cleaning up her neighborhood and for transforming a lesson from her parents into a positive and impactful life. And be it further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby declare Tuesday, April 29, 2025, to be Lila Worth Day in the City of Pittsburgh. May we have a motion to approve. Motion to approve. All those in favor say aye, Aye, Aye, Congratulations, Congratulations. Would you like to say a few words. Oh, yeah, sure. So, hi, I'm Lila. I did start this because I got grounded a while back, But I like I go to this park every day and I'm like I'm going to go to this park every day And I'm like I'm going to go to this park every day And I'm like I'm going to go to this park every day And I'm like I'm going to go to this park every day, But I like I go to this park all the time behind my house, Dilworth Park, And I constantly find myself picking up trash there. I once found a broken TV, shattered glass, And my fear for children's safety and animal safety is just always there, because I want to make sure that everybody else is safe. Thank you, Amazing, Amazing. All right, Can we get all the votes? All right? Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Can we get all the members up here for a photo please? Okay, We have another one from Councilwoman Kale Smith, who unfortunately couldn't be here today. Everyone here for Autism Awareness Month, which I think is Joe representing for the group. Okay, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Whereas autism is the fastest growing developmental disability in the United States, the most recent CDC data indicates that approximately 1 in 36 children and an estimated 5. 5- 5. 4 million adults have been identified with autism spectrum disorder. And whereas autism is the result of a neurological disorder that affects the normal functioning of the human brain and can affect anyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or socio-economic economic background. And whereas symptoms and characteristics of autism may present themselves in a variety of combinations and can result in significant lifelong impairment of an individual's ability to learn, develop healthy, interactive behaviors and understand verbal as well as nonverbal communication. And whereas, while the effort to address autism continues, doctors, therapists and educators can help persons with autism overcome or adjust to its challenges by providing early, accurate diagnoses and the resulting appropriate education, intervention and therapy that are so vital to an affected individual's growth and development. And whereas it should be the shared goal of all residents of our city to ensure that persons living with autism have access to the lifelong care and services needed to pursue the fullest measure of personal happiness and achieve their greatest potential. And whereas the City of Pittsburgh is honored to take part in the annual observance of Autism Awareness Month, In the hope that it will lead to a better understanding of the disorder in our communities. Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby ask for all Pittsburghers to help raise the public awareness of autism, to create more inclusive and understanding communities for individuals with autism and their families, And be it further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby declare the month of April 2025 to be Autism Awareness Month in the City of Pittsburgh. Mayor, we have a motion to approve. Motion to approve. All those in favor say aye, Aye, Congratulations. Could you guys just say a few words? Okay, So, and I'll just add my own, I think that we have some great examples- Some are elected leaders in our region, some are other leaders in the region- that you can truly thrive with autism and be leaders in the community as well. So I wanted to add that you know it's called a disorder, but I think it can also be a superpower. Thank you, So would all members like to come up and join us? If not, you can just sit back and watch for a moment. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. And we have two to be read into the record. Council person Charlene presents: be it further resolved, in recognition of the artistic and social impact of Montez Freeland and his work within the Greater Pittsburgh region, that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby declare April 25th 2025 to be Montez Freeland day in the City of Pittsburgh. and Councilman Smith presents: be it further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby declare Sunday, May 4th 2025 to be Tim Stevens day in the City of Pittsburgh. motion to approve. all those in favor say aye, aye. proclamations have been approved. that takes us to a will of counsel from Councilwoman Warwick. would you like it read this entirety? I would, if that's alright, thank you. thank you, Councilwoman Warwick. presents: whereas, unless it receives new funding from the state, Pittsburgh Regional Transit has announced catastrophic cuts and fixed route services of up to 35%, with an additional 9% increase in fares. and whereas the impacts of the possible cuts on dis disabled riders would be even more profound, with paratransit service cuts of 62% and fares increased by 20%. and whereas the cuts would eliminate 41 bus routes entirely, while making major reductions to service on 34 routes and and slight reductions in service on another 20 routes, and they would eliminate service after 11 pm. And whereas these cuts would be devastating to the tens of thousands of Pittsburghers who rely every day on public transportation, making it difficult or impossible for them to get to work, school, medical appointments, grocery stores and every other necessity more than walking distance away. And whereas to keep the existing service intact, PRT is asking state officials for a 117 million funding increase in the 2026 fiscal year, And whereas in 2024, Governor Josh Shapiro redirected 153 million in funding to SEPTA to prevent fare increases and deep service cuts to that agency. And whereas PRT is an economic driver that serves 120,000 daily riders, contributes 1 billion to the state economy and keeps 39,000 cars off the road. And whereas the city of Pittsburgh is dedicated to being a livable city for all, which includes the one in four Pittsburgh households who do not have access to a car and who need reliable, affordable and accessible public transportation. And whereas the damage these cuts would do to our city, to the city of Pittsburgh, would be a huge loss for the city's transit riders, economy and overall livability- is incalculable. Now, therefore, be it resolved. the council of the city of Pittsburgh hereby urges the Pennsylvania General Assembly and Governor Shapiro to increase funding to Pittsburgh Regional Transit by at least 117 million in the 2026 fiscal year to prevent a catastrophic loss of transit service And be it further resolved. the councilary would another necessary cash in there who may be available for principal or related benefit to the Allegheny County Delegations of the Pennsylvania State General Assembly and to the Office of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Mayor Rabbjin, may we have a motion to approve? Motion to approve: Second With discussion. councilman, Yeah, thank you. I appreciate you reading the will of council. as the various bodies of government, we need to come together and work together and really, you know this is not the time to say, oh well, PRT is not my problem, or oh well, that's right, like this is not a PRT problem, this is not a county problem, or you know, this is a problem for all of us across the region. And so you know, whether it's the SPC, the business community, city council, the mayor's office, county exec, et cetera, you know, county council, et cetera, and our state partners, we really need to come together to ensure, not just to be honest, that we have this emergency funding right to keep our transit from being cut, but that we have strong, dedicated transit funding going forward. Transit and housing are inextricably linked and we already have, you know. you know, as folks are not able to work or to afford to live in the city of Pittsburgh, they are moving outside to the boroughs and transit, and it makes it incredibly hard for people to get in to jobs in the city of Pittsburgh without a car. So, you know, as we're working on growing our affordable housing, we also need to be working on not just saving but improving our transit service, because it is a lifeline to jobs, healthcare, school, et cetera for our most vulnerable residents. But even even more than that, and this is what I would really underscore to you know, perhaps our Republican colleagues in other counties, you know, around Allegheny County, et cetera, transit is an economic driver In this day and age a city like Pittsburgh is. you know, if we are going to grow economically, we need to be attracting people from you know, places like the Silicon Valley, Chicago, the tri-state area, right, And people who live in those places and companies that are operating in those places that may have an eye on Pittsburgh. the fact that you that it's very difficult to get around not just the county but even the city, right, Even just in the heart of our city, it can be very difficult to get around without a car, right, You need a car to go a mile and a half and that is not attractive to people who want to move to. to me, that is sort of the you know as someone who lives in a safe neighborhood with a good school and all the great stuff I love where I live in Pittsburgh. but the transit is an issue. right, I'm lucky I have a car. but if I were looking at places, if I were used to public transit, if I were used to living in a city that had, you know, outstanding transit, it would be an issue, It would be something that would sort of raise an eyebrow if I were looking at Pittsburgh, and I think that will be the same for employers and, you know, companies that are looking to move here. So, yeah, thanks to all my colleagues for signing on to this. and you know, I know, in June Pittsburghers for Public Transit is organizing- I don't know when exactly, but some kind of rally day to go to Harrisburg. You know, I hope that you know, together with Philly, with folks in Philly. so I hope that we can. all I know, on May 5th the SPC is going to be in Harrisburg. I'm going to head to, you know, head down there for the day with them. to you know, try and have some meetings around this, but really really underscore in every way we can across the aisle that not only do we need to save transit in Allegheny County, we really need to start investing in it in a meaningful way, because great cities have great transit. so thanks, Thank you. Any further comments? Councilman Mosley? Yeah, first I want to thank Councilwoman Warwick, my apologies. I'd like to thank Councilman Strasburger for meeting with me today. I know I've said so many things, but today I want to thank Councilwoman Warwick for her leadership on this will of council. You know I've always been a huge proponent of public transit. It's Council President Lavelle who we've known each other for many, many years. He used to be my ride when we were much younger, in our 20s, hanging out when we worked on this floor for a councilman Dean. he always made fun of me for not having my driver's license. We were in our early 20s and so I know the the public transit system. you know on a personal level and know the importance of having a robust public transit system, particularly at this time as this council is deliberating zoning codes and planning initiatives that require a level of density that also requires a robust public transit system, But we're going to have the kind of density and growth that we're looking at as we embark on a historic, comprehensive plan. So this is not the time to be pulling back from transit, but actually to be doubling down and investing in transit, you know, and not only just in the service that we have, but expanding rapid transit, whether it's bus rapid transit or, in my perfect world, expanding our light rail infrastructure to different parts of the county, as well as beginning to think about the conversation that Senator Costa started over the weekend about looking at expanding our transit system to a regional transit system. So I think we're going to have to start with the transit system and not having this hodgepodge of several eight different county authorities, you know, that work together very inefficiently, with a lot of duplication, You know. so now is the time, you know, for us to be doubling down on transit and, as we go and look at what Pittsburgh's going to be in 2050, I would hope that it's a Pittsburgh that has a robust transit system and, like my colleague, Councilwoman Warwick said, there's not a great, you know, city in the world that doesn't have a great public transit system, and I want Pittsburgh to be among the group of cities known to be some of the greatest cities in the world. So I think it's incumbent upon us, whether we are county officials or state officials or municipal officials or advocates- And I believe this afternoon at 1: 30 there is a rally downtown at Pitt Avenue, headed by the transit advocates. I know there's going to be- some of us will be there, some other elected officials, as well as the public comment period, and we'll stay open until June, if you go to rodprtorg. So thank you, Councilwoman Warwick, Thank you to all the members for supporting this, and I look forward to going to Harrisburg and all other forms of advocacy so that we can save transit as it is but then begin to build a much better transit system in the future. Thank you very much. Thank you, Councilwoman Warwick, for bringing this forward. I'll simply add this is not a problem that was not unknown. The governor, to Councilman Mosley's point, helped out SEPTA, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority. thank you, helped them out a year ago with the funding they needed to make sure that they were able to be sustainable going into the future, And so now we need the governor to indeed do the same in this case. So thank you for bringing this forward. All those in favor say aye, Aye. Any opposed? The will of council has been approved. That will take us to public comment and I will move to the next item. I would like to remind everyone that the rules of council state that comments are limited to matters of concern, official action or deliberation which may be before city council. Profanity will not be permitted. After you recall, please restate your name, provide your neighborhood for the record. You'll be given three minutes to speak. Our first registered speaker is Stormy Morris. Hi, City Council, Stormy Morris. I live in McKeesport now. When I was younger, I used to be a member of the Homewood Youth Group and our leader was Jerry Murray And he used to take us around to talent shows and television shows and just help us, help the community in the best way that we could. We used to volunteer and things like that. So one day we had to go to Channel 11 to tape a show And before we taped the show somebody pulled Jerry Murray aside and said: yeah, we heard that you're going to have your kids down at the convention center to perform And Mr Murray said, yeah, I am. And he said: well, we really don't think that they can represent the black community too well, So we don't want them to come down there. And Mr Murray was upset about it, but there was really nothing he could do about it. So we did perform at Channel 11, But what we didn't know was Lorne Mann was standing outside of the door waiting for his turn to tape his segment. And he made a phone call The next day. Mr Murray came up to us in a meeting and he said: by the way, we are invited to dance at the convention center. And we all were happy, of course. And what I learned from Lorne Mann is: when you want to change the world, little things, just little things at a time- get involved. He didn't know us, He didn't care about us, But he heard the situation and he got involved. And last night I was at the mayor debate at the Kingsley Center and there was a lot of people talking about young people in Pittsburgh that need help, And I help young people too, but because I work a lot, I can't get involved as much as I would like to. So right now I would like to present a 5,000 money order to Pittsburgh City Council And I'm asking you to help the young people because I know, you know where everything is and who needs help. So, whether it's a girl that needs a prom dress, a kid that needs a pair of shoes, maybe a student at CMU is short on lunch money, something, So just take this and help the young people, Thank you. Thank you very much. Our next speaker is Dr Ronald N Miller. Dr Ronald N Miller, downtown Helsinki, Finland. In the early 2000s, I became a member of the American Physical Society, the American Philosophical Association and the American Academy of Religion, And I'm also the author of Global Intelligence 2010 to 2025, the Global Intelligence Society. Candidate for President 2028: globalinformationintelligencenetworknet Council. concerns include the local vote and local housing. This is consistent with two initiatives of mine for 2028: one vote by voter verification for whom to approach the Supreme Court, And also I'm a member of the National Council of the United States and I'm part of the National Security Council's local government advocacy committee. Since I was a little boy, I've been a member of the National Security Council And I'm a member of the National Security Council and I'm also a member of the local government primacy. Last week, on 22 April 2025, a disabled veteran said to me, sat down beside me and said to me: I've been listening to you on Public City Channel and you make some good points, But he didn't tell me what a good point is. What is a good point? So what I'm going to do is to specify using three and a triad that I use in global intelligence of physics, philosophy and religious studies. In physical studies, physics a good is a solution to a problem. A point is that other solutions are reduced to zero value. The approach that is taken in philosophical studies is that good. basically, baseline here is a syllogistic argument in which there's a proposition A and it's added to a proposition B to get to conclusion C And the essential point is that there are other options which are excluded. So it reduces the alternatives, the plausible alternatives, to zero. In religious studies, if I can focus for a moment on Hinayana Buddhism, the good is the decrease of suffering and the point is the zero self or the no self. Move, move, let him speak. I can't hear him. Please go, let him speak. I can't hear him. There's a little interruption here. So what I want, what I think, is that these show that we need to get to a zero in order to have a constructive one. in housing, That means one individual in one house, very small, lowest cost, one to 1,000, and do it within a month. Thank you very much. Our next speaker is Zosia Minifield. Do not see Zosia online. Is Zosia Minifield with us? If not, our next speaker is Ayas Azuni. I'm also not see online. Therefore, our next speaker is Nicole Schaefer. Hi, good morning council members. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. My name is Nicole Schaefer, 1437 Browning Road in Highland Park. I come to you today when I was a student. I was a student a interjected speaker on all funerals at a lot of officemomentaminers, but I wanted to believe that I was useful and that's not a bad thing for me. I had a greatoy part of an ever dwindling club of city assets that are beloved and well used for programming that reflects the needs of our communities, while scraping by to make spectacular results on shoestring budgets. in the past, this scrappy approach has worked, but today i must tell you, kingsley is at a crossroads. despite rising costs, skyrocketing utilities, staffing needs and the massive expense of operating an indoor pool- which those of you that have a hot tub or a pool know that the amount of money that you spend on those are- it's a sinking ship- kingsley has received far too little public or private investment compared to the essential services it provides. it does not receive rad funding like other public assets in our city. it doesn't receive any substantial funds from silver sneakers or the wellness programming it provides at low or no cost to upmc and highmark subscribers, mainly our seniors. it gets pennies on the reimbursements from public assistance and yet it's a proud and humble organization that opens its stores to all, without question. it's easy to assume that community centers should be free, yet nothing about maintaining a beautiful, open and joyful facility, paying living wages to lifeguards and educators and non-profit employees, and keeping the lights on and water warm for a family swim night. none of that's free. running a facility like the kingsley requires the same care and resources that we invest in infrastructure like roads and waterways, bridges, our public transportation and water systems, because community infrastructure is every bit as essential to health, wellness and by resilience of our city. while the corporate landscape continues to expand, offering services accessible to only those who can pay, kingsley stands as one of the few places where the doors are open to everyone, offering tangible benefits: swim lessons, youth workforce training, senior fitness classes and technology for underserved communities. and yet it provides intangible benefits that are harder to quantify, but in a way that makes it possible for us to live without. it's a technology that is unique and truly important to people all across the country. it's a technology that is not even possible to live without. it fights isolation. it builds civic connection across race, class and generation. it creates spaces for joyful engagement, leadership, development and public trust. in the coming weeks you're going to hear from a variety of voices that will share with you the imperfect storm that's created a situation that the scrappiest creatives can't innovate in front of. if we fail to act now, in the next 120 days, the city and county do not step forward with critical support. we risk ask you as a citizen, thank you very much. the urban infrastructure and the access it includes for the invisible and fast thank you. you can also always submit your comments to the clerk's office so we can get them in full. that exhausts our list of registered speakers. if there's anyone in chambers wishing to speak, please come forward at the time, provide your name and neighborhood for the record. you also give three minutes to speak. i am burning to meet you. thank you, mayor gainey, for realizing the mental health help needs for the homeless, the addiction issues with the homeless population. it's because they do not have the mental health help and medical help so they self-medicate to numb. i'm an old-school medical transcriptionist. that was before the legal secretary and the paralegal hats of many, before the age of electronics. we, we old ladies, had to transcribe those doctors notes. i still do shorthand. bernie, come take a note. mr so-and-so is self-medicating with pain and alcohol for his pain with alcohol and street drugs. note to selves when you're sleeping on the ground you're going to self-medicate. bernie, take a note. miss hoosie watson never had mental health treatment as a child and has learned not safe behavior and is self-medicating with alcohol and street drugs to dull the low self-esteem at mercy. when an addict was admitted it was not unusual for a doctor to order beer for a patient. why the sudden stop of the drugs and alcohol will kill a patient on the streets begging for money. they are begging not to die. corey is pushing click catch phrases. we need transparency. click phrases for the soapbox speech like the old paradigm social construct woke now the word transparency and the law of the law is a law of the law. we need transparency. corey must be watching a whole bunch of love and love and marriage in huntsville because they use the word transfer. parents see all the time, but here's the reality- to transparency. you can't say you're going to get us transparency in government when we have sunshine laws and the right to know laws. the sunshine blog made windows to government. we already have transparency. you can't promise to give us what we already have. mayor ganey, thank you. behavior, health teams for the homeless and the health and wellness groups are going to be the best place to be and we're going to be the best place to be and we're going to be the best place to be. and i would strongly suggest start hiring social worker grads and train them to be police officers. imagine the possibilities. create incentives that the current officers can get online degree programs. we have all these universities up the street that don't pay taxes, educate, are already in place and are going forward. our police officers, the whole entire public safety staff- get them credentialed. make these non-paying entities. do something for the city that will actually help us, thank you. thank you very much, next speaker, please. good morning, my name is yvonne f brown. i brought my sign again. i'd just like to say thank god that we're holding all this up. this has been 1 million. we've also wonangan's bidding, so this has been 1. 5 million. we have been holding a maximum of 6 Thursday drink and movie jack, the human rights justice Discordable 5 in every bank. you can round up 15 plus 3. total to 9 money promised to 50 percent of 2019. we've still got a handling to Q. measures are being made. staying inside, because now the open breaking down that table I have over here i could take a lot of leave. this is at business. my social security and I am going to join the membership again. I have been a little lax, the same as you have been, but the NAACP fought for us. They have brought out things that we did not know about. I have to stop for a minute because, Mr Warwick, I need to speak directly to you for you to understand what I am saying. When someone is standing up here speaking citizens who have taken their time to come down, where, as you are still sitting home and calling the phone and make your announcement, We come here, you come and you stand behind and he is talking and you are running and talking. You are supposed to wait until we get finished. We have three minutes, that's all, And you know what I have made up my mind. I was going to come down. I was coming down with a good spirit. a good spirit. I was going to come down and say you know what? I am going to hear it, But you are really trying me, because the law says we have three minutes and you cannot keep your behind up here at the table or up here without coming back here While we are talking. you are in somebody's ear, Do you understand? Do you understand We have three minutes and we have a lot to say. I know I do. I have been coming here for 20 something years and the disrespect I received from you staff, even you, Mr, your wife- I know your wife- I mean, I tell you I'm gonna just stop because I am sick and tired of the disrespect. You should be charged 5 any time you get up from that table. So if five years of, not a year's ain't fair, we got 45, we can get, and maybe we can use for ourselves, Maybe we can take it. hold the table, We can have the table. You know, I'm just so confused because I don't understand how you became council people and don't realize that we are supposed to be given honor and respect. The honor is to shut your mouth while we're talking three minutes. You just do hours, hours. We have to sit here hours and just run your mouth during the three little minutes. Do you understand? 60 seconds times three? That's all we got And you just got it. You got hours and you run your mouth repeating the same stuff over. Oh, I like the way you said that, Mr So-and-so.
