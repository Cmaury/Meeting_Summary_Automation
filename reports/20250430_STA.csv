• The new system creates a backup order using committee chairs instead of requiring council members to vote for a temporary leader during the meeting.

• If the president and vice president can't attend, the Finance Committee chair will automatically lead the meeting first.

• If the Finance chair is also absent, leadership goes to the Public Safety chair, then Public Works chair, then Human Resources chair.

• Council President Lavelle sponsored the change after a recent problem when both he and the vice president were absent, forcing council members to spend time voting on who should lead that day's meeting.

• Lavelle said he had asked another council member to chair a meeting but forgot the rules required a vote first, creating confusion.

• The council's legislative manager helped write the new rules to prevent similar problems in the future.

• The resolution passed with council approval and moves forward in the legislative process."

• Pittsburgh City Council approved a resolution allowing the city to place temporary construction easements on city-owned land for the Smithfield Street reconstruction project

• The easements will give construction crews access to city property they need to rebuild, repair, and fix Smithfield Street

• The project is being overseen by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) because it uses federal and state money

• The city had to create a right-of-way plan showing which properties are needed for construction work and staging areas

• The easements are temporary and will only last during construction - they won't cost the city any money

• The city will record the right-of-way plan with the Allegheny County Recorder of Deeds to make the easements official

• The resolution gives the Directors of Finance and Mobility and Infrastructure departments the authority to handle the paperwork and legal steps needed"

So yeah, thanks, Gavin, If you wanna introduce yourself and then just talk a little bit about what we're looking at here. Hi everybody. Thanks Council for having me this morning. We're really excited about this project and I'll say River Life is committed to community engagement in all of our projects. so we're typically out there well in advance doing work in the community and sharing what these projects might look like. This one's a bit of a special case because we wanted to make sure that this was a sort of fun surprise for this summer. so this has not really been shared publicly yet. but as you've heard in the resolution, we're bringing a barge to town, So the intent is to have that sited at Allegheny Landing. The barge will have and if you in that folder there wanna pass out, we've got some visuals. Thank you very much. The barge will be landing at the Allegheny Landing dock, which we've restored with coordination with the city in the last couple of years. So it'll actually have a sort of drawbridge that drops down onto that barge and enables people, fully accessible, to get onto this platform that will sit out into the channel. It will have a concession space which will be powered by solar, so it's not connected into the grid, It's all sort of self-sufficient. A few of the things that I wanna note here is that we've gone through quite a number of novel permitting processes for this effort, because it is a sort of- I don't know- a full-time job. It's not just a small, you know it's a small, you know. you know it's not just a small, you know. you know it's a small. you know it's a small, you know. you know it's a small. you know it's a small. you know it's a small. you know it's a strange space in the regulatory space, But we are actively working on that. This license agreement is important and sort of capstone part of that approvals process and that is for, specifically, the landing this year. The intent is to be out there for the summer, warmer months, so late May, early June through October of the year. That's all contingent upon these final approvals. We're not going to be able to get the permits that we're working toward, but that's the hope And we will have that be open and available to the public at all hours where we can have somebody staffed on board. You do not have to purchase anything to be there. It's really meant to be an extension of that park. The last thing I'll say is that we're excited about the possibilities of this barge one being able to move, because it's got fixed pilings basically attached to the barge itself So it could move around the Pittsburgh pool to other neighborhoods which we want to support, And then it also has the ability to change shape. It's actually 10 modular sections that can move around to different orientations, And so we're excited to bring this to you in new iterations in future years. but this is year one and we hope you approve so we can get this thing out on the water. Great, Thank you. So just this seems very cool. So this is like the first thing that we're going to do in the first year. So the first year we'll do it, or if we pass it here and then, with the hope of future years. I'm just sort of thinking. I'm thinking about the draft. I know that's in April, I believe, So is that going to be maybe still too cold? I don't know. April can be a challenging month on the rivers from a water flow perspective. Oh, okay, So it can be somewhat dangerous at times to have vessels out there on the water, but we have been having conversations about whether that might be possible, and we'd be happy to support so long as the weather is good, Okay, And where do you keep this thing when it's not out on the water? We're working with an operator up in Katanning, so it's stored there with his other barges, and we'll be fleeted there during the winter months to keep it safe. Okay, I don't think I have any other questions. Thank you. We have Councilman Wilson, followed by Councilman Coghill. Thank you, Chair. I just want to say thank you for involving me in the conversation years ago. I'm thinking maybe it was probably back in 2018, or maybe it was in the spring, I don't know. I'm thinking maybe it was in the spring of 2021, 2022. discussing this, It just makes you realize how long it takes to even come to this point. So thanks for all the great work that River Life does, because without organizations like yourself we would be challenged. So it's great to have several extra arms that are all helping out here and looking forward to it, And I know that this isn't just exclusive for my district. everyone in the city and everyone practically that visits Pittsburgh will be in this dock at some point. So thanks for all your efforts. Thanks, Councilman, Thank you Councilman Coghill, Thank you, Madam Chair, Thanks, Gavin, for the information. This does seem really really cool to me. So my first question is: this is not your typical barge. This has like a floor, like a finished floor. basically It's like a stage. Yeah, I mean it will be steel, but it is a flat finished surface. You can roll on it. It's not just jumping on it. It's got some dimples but yeah, it'll be finished in a way, Because it looks really nice from here. It'll have railings And there's going to be like a little rooftop here of some sort. that's on it now or is it? It's not yet. It will be and we're working with an artist actually to do a very interesting sort of natural shade canopy structure for the people Got it. So I guess you're going to have to have like a walkway, or is it going to be fixed right to the shore. The gangway will be attached to the barge and it'll actually be a sort of drawbridge mechanism, So it'll come down and then up for safety, Right, right, And you say the pylons- basically it's anchors. You could lift the anchors and they go actually into the riverbed, or not? The pilings- they're called spuds when they're attached to the barge, do go into the riverbed And those will be supplemented by some anchors at the back of the barge in case there are any issues. Something like yesterday happens, right, Suspenders, You'll be like a speedboat. So no, it sounds really interesting. Who is going to do it? I mean, you said you're going to run the food concession and that stuff. If it's okay, we did do a public process for vendors. We haven't announced that yet and I think my director of communications might be mad if I did. Yeah, so there were people bidding for, actively bidding, to run the concession, basically Probably restauranteurs in and around, probably the North Shore, mostly Throughout the city. Yeah, okay, okay, You don't need life preservers or anything like that. We will have life rings, throw bags and AED and all of that. We're working directly with public safety and river rescue to make sure that our safety and operations manual complies with anything that they want to see. So, if approved, when is the earliest we could see this? I'm going to say at this point, realistically, sometime in June is a pretty safe bet. Okay, That's it for me, Madam Chair. Thank you, and thank you, Gavin. My pleasure, Thank you, Thank you. Any further discussion? I recall visiting the site where you were, The site where this was going to be, at least a year and a half ago maybe, And so I know that the funding was an issue and I know that you know, just as Councilman Wilson mentioned, all the bureaucratic processes you have to go through at all levels of government. So congratulations on getting to this point. Thank you, Very, very exciting. It's been a fun learning process, And what better way for those visiting Pittsburgh for a convention or for some other reason to see the city than by, you know, by boat on our rivers? Thank you All right. Further discussion. Seeing none. all those in favor of Bill 1751, please indicate by saying aye, Aye, Aye, Appreciate the visuals too.

So on Rule 16-d by-law, 20-3-se, Title N. 9 Zoning, Article 2: Based Zoning Districts, Chapter 903- Residential Zoning Districts to Reduce Required Minimum L loafs gözl-in Motion to approve the discussion. second First Brother, as to what this bill does, what the concerns are, and want to thank this body for for taking up this bill, to discuss it and hopefully pass it, because what i believe you know this bill does is is a lot and, quite frankly, you know it's something that i'm quite kind of embarrassed that back in 2020, when i got an office, it wasn't the first bill that i introduced or worked on, because you know, a bill like this it's it's being touted as i know it's being touted as a bill that solves the problems of iz that some you know to make it work, inclusionary zoning iz, but though may be the case for for units that are above 20, but just recently there was a variance that was denied for five units in the city and this, this bill would solve that. i know there's concerns, that you know, developers just make money and the lawyers represent them to make money. but quite frankly, the everyone in the business makes more money when we have more restrictive laws. they just quite they. they get more money when there's court cases on variants. so you know, i i don't think this is, you know, the answer to making iz work. we all know that to make inclusion or zoning work, there's, there's a lot of work to do currently in lawrenceville, right with the current, recent current projects there, and those don't pencil out unless, well, only if, there's ratification of the housing Action code for rent at the distinct section. is Considering this coming out in fairest of its formation footage required to build on a lot, nothing more. contextual setbacks, height limits and other protections remain in place. this change helps us unlock vacant land, all the work that we do at the land bank. every time we celebrate the land bank we are celebrating, you know, the great work they do, but we could be doing so much more. and you know this bill really provides an opportunity for all families, especially working families, to, you know, make housing more affordable, more accessible and it's just a better use of our neighborhoods instead of making abandoned, you know, parcels in between houses. so it's time to- i believe it's time to get this done and i'm proud to move forward today. thank you, council person warwick. yeah, thanks, so you know. just a few thoughts. obviously, this- i don't believe this- was on the agenda until about 10 minutes before the meeting started, which, you know, given that we had a public hearing that was clearly, you know, divide. you know the public is divided, at least if we're basing it on that hearing. we had about half of the people who are very concerned about affordable housing and inclusionary zoning, who are in favor of this bill but want to see it, you know, come to fruition, together with the requirements that units- you know that projects with 20 units or more have 10 of those units reserved as affordable so that we can, you know, create neighborhoods that are for folks of all income levels. so, and then the other half, of course, where our our yimby folks, who you know are anti-iz, no matter which way you slice it. so i think that sort of slipping this in quickly before a meeting, the morning after a major natural disaster is an interesting choice. that said, you know, as far as the bill itself, i agree this is a good bill. that is why, you know, almost immediately when i came to office, and all these same folks right are, are pro-housing pittsburgh folks, architects, developers, etc. you know when we were, you know, saying we need zoning reform and this was one of the number one issues that my team sat down with all these folks to: to craft, craft this legislation and then and then have it and and then, you know, press for the administration to include it in the housing, in the, in the, in the package. so again, you know- i've said this over and over again- we clearly have two views. there's there's the view that that we should, you know, just do everything we can to allow developers to build as much as they want, wherever they want. and and, by the way, there is, we do have a tax abatement for affordability. so if you choose to do affordability, whether it's in the iz district now or just in general, you get an abatement for that, i believe. so, so, so there is, i'll, you know, i'll let councilwoman gross speak to that, i'm sure, if she's online, but at any rate, i just feel like you know, we do have a public hearing coming up about councilman charlotte's bill in a couple of weeks, i believe, and you know, i just i really feel that this needs to be. i, i am, i am a big fan of this bill. i i, you know, my team and i worked to write this and put it into the housing needs assessment package. i i'm i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to do that, but i'm, i am very dismayed that, as sort of the, the, the major incentive, the one thing that the developer community wanted, you know, in good faith, my team and i worked to get this in because it is important we do need to be able to build more. you know we shouldn't be restricting our you know how many units we can build. you know this bill makes sense, but it also is sort of the, the carrots, so to speak. that will help. i think in this bill, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the design of the bill is included as part of our mindset and is kind of- you knowSteer'smmiss essere, that is nfestan, is kind of revolutionary. you know, taking, conspiring Agora, owohh, both goals, if you want, OiI, that's not really, you know, the many pillar A, the no, but also My, do think, definitely do neighborhoods like we have in the Strip, where it's just, you know, playground for wealthy tech folks to actually create, you know, use those neighborhoods to create mixed income communities like we have in Pittsburgh. because that's what's so, that's what's so great about Pittsburgh is it is this city where you can, you know, you can- be a Google exec and go to a, you know, go to a bar or go to a party and be, you know, hanging out with people who are, you know, from all walks of life, doing all different kinds of jobs, whether they're a roofer or whatever. That's what I love about my neighborhood. But you know, yeah, I'm just, I'm obviously a big fan of this bill. It's very good, it's a good bill, But I'm very dismayed to see it move forward without this, this council, working to make sure that lower income and working folks also have a piece and that our market rate developers also play a part in creating affordable housing in our city, because our taxpayers are certainly playing a role. Our taxpayers, you know, our money, taxpayer, dollars. everybody in the city of Pittsburgh is paying a lot in order to make sure that we can keep this city affordable, And I feel that our market rate developers should be participating in that. There are lots of ways for them to do that using public dollars. And this was the real juicy thing. This was the thing they wanted, This was the biggest thing they wanted. I know there's like the parking stuff and there's the ADUs, you know, but this was the, this was the. you know, this was the big prize And yeah, anyway, I think it's, I think it's unfortunate that we're not doing them both together, Which is how, how the housing needs assessment package was brought to us And now it's, it's being sort of broken up bit by bit. Anyway, I've, I've said this all before and I'll just I'll leave, All right. Well, I would like to do a motion to hold for two weeks, just to kind of let folks weigh in. I'll put that on the table, if I can. We have I'm, I'm going to ask that you hold your motion to hold, let others say their piece, We can do a motion to hold and then we'll take a vote and then we'll, yeah, move from there. Okay, Yeah, So we have Councilman Coghill and then I know Councilwoman Gross is online. wish to speak? Thank you, Thank you, Madam Chair. Well, I will say this: It sounds like all parties are in agreement that this is a good thing. I am as well. I think to me it's. I'm a firm believer in order to increase housing of all sorts. Including affordable is through zoning, not through mandatory action to include inclusionary zoning with developers. When you start subdividing lots and lose parking requirements, it makes it affordable to that general contractor to come in and build two, whether it be tiny homes or whatever. So so I don't think that's in dispute as far as like who agrees with the, the bill that's in front of us today. It sounds like everybody agrees with it. I am not looking at this bill as leverage where I feel like maybe you are, Councilman, Councilwoman Warwick, toward getting IZ in there, Maybe the developers gave you that impression or somebody give you that impression, but I'm adamantly against inclusionary zoning. So this to me, is the direction, And thank you, Councilman Wilson, for pushing the conversation to where it should be, I feel, in zoning and planning And, you know, making it easier for people to build, So so, so with that, yeah, I'm in full support. I don't see any reason to hold this up when everybody's in agreement and it's at least doing action where the other two bills. you know this will eventually be a part of whether it be Councilman Charlene's bill, the administration's bill or a combination of both, but this belongs in either, or so I see no reason in holding up. So thank you, And thank you, Councilman Wilson, for you know, for your time. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, but but that you know, I'm still in that process. I'm still in, you know, working on this issue. Thank you, Council. Councilwoman gross, Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you Appreciate it. so I just want members to understand that there have been apartment buildings at 350 total units completed under the Ozzy and Lawrenceville. There's another 267 near construction units completion in the IZ in Lawrenceville. There are 20 unit projects near completion in the IZ in Lawrenceville- And I'm working on my phone and I think I could actually make that number longer. There's a building which you can drive by and see on Melwood, outside of Post Hill in the Oakland IZ, which is gosh, at least 10 stories tall, nearly completed in the IZ. So members who don't have any inclusionary zoning in their districts, who don't see the buildings right in front of them that have inclusionary zoning units maybe should not make assumptions about projects in the inclusionary zoning districts Moving on to minimum lot size. Absolutely, this is something that is makes sense for a lot of reasons. I agree that on the small parcels- it's what some people call the lots, parts of my district, the townhouses or the tiny single family homes that were built 100 years ago on narrow streets and tiny lots to be close to trolley lines were built without a minimum lot size and without setbacks, basically from the edge of the parcel. So I'm entirely supportive. I do also want to remind council members again who do not have any inclusionary zoning in their districts that every project that includes 10% at 50% affordable- which is what is proposed to go beyond Bloomfield, Polishell, Lawrenceville and Oakland, where it is now to move beyond that- automatically qualifies for an additional 60 feet of height. if you do not do 10% at 50% AMI of the units, you don't get a bonus two floors of apartments, right. so imagine you're on a site where it allows you to do five floors of apartments you opt to do. you can opt to do it now. you could opt to do it now. it's outside. you could opt to do it now and left side, 10%. at 50% ami, you automatically get two more floors and, trust me, on large sites that can be another 80 units. these are very large buildings. that is in place right now. you also get Alerdea that this council, before you served on it, put in place. that allows for up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of tax abatement per year for 10, for 10 years. so I think those are already bonuses that are in place. there is no reason to rush this through because this imaginary suggestion, right this, this kind of false suggestion that this is going to unlock projects that aren't penciling right now. this council has already, over the years, put bonuses in place that are there already on the books and that developers use. so I also think that that this discussion should be. it is part of the package that some members of council have blocked for council discussion and I would rather take it up when we can take up the other package. I think it makes sense as part of the other package. it's it's not bad language, just councilwoman Warwick's office wrote it. I support the language, but it is meant to be a part of a bigger, more impactful housing reform. so I support. thank you. that's all I'm sure. thank you. is there any further discussion? first round: okay, I will say no. yeah, oh sorry, no worries, please, please proceed. council president, thank you, sorry I couldn't be there in person today. power, PPS not peeing and PPS being closed, etc. etc. so, towards everyone else's comments, I'm supportive of the bill. so I'll say that upfront. but I am torn as we sit here today on whether or not, if we chose to vote this today, would I actually support it. and it's not about the bill, it is about the process. councilman Wilson mentioned all the speakers who came down for the public hearing a week ago, probably two to one those speakers. what they said were, yes, we all support this bill, but we want to have the fuller conversation. we want to have this conversation in context with all the other things. and while, yes, each bill that is sort of talked about as the quote-unquote package are independent bills, so we can't absolutely take them independently- I want to be clear about that- it doesn't mean that we shouldn't be having the fuller conversation, which is what was asked of us. unfortunately, we're not having the fuller conversation because council voted to hold a bill, an IZ bill- for six weeks. that I believe comes back up for discussion next week and we can't have the fuller conversation until we deal with that, and so it would be my preference to not vote this until we have disposed or voted in some capacity on that bill that will come up for discussion next week. that will then allow for us to begin talking about the full conversation of: yes, isia. yes, minimum lot size. yes, accessory dwelling units. yes, parking requirements- restricting parking requirements- that various members have worked on dead. obviously, i'm not sorry. i'm sorry, barb obviously initially worked on this bill. i know, councilman strassberger, you've worked on the parking stuff a lot and we've all had our own various opinions, but we're not having the full conversation which i think we should, which is what the public asked us to do. so i would support the two-week hole so that we can next week have the iz bill before us, which needs held for a public hearing. so if the, if, the, if there's a need, the motion to hold for two weeks, i'll be certainly supportive of that. i'm torn on how i would actually vote today, because what i heard loud and clear was: yes, we want you to do this. no, there's no rush to get this done today. we can hold it for a couple weeks, in my personal opinion, dispose of a bill that will require seven members to vote for it. there's definitely not seven members that are going to vote for it. i can tell that with absolute certainty- and then move this bill and the other bills forward, whether those are as individual bills or whether they're all on the table at the same time. that's the conversation we can collectively have, but i think that's the most prudent thing to do, thank you, thank you all. right, we'll go to second round in a minute. i'm going to make some remarks first. so first i do want to thank, of course, councilman wilson for bringing this up and for his work on this, but i want to thank council person warwick mccarım and the community back and forth on this. prior to this, i do want to thank the mem prochain because she's been so present and as a physician and economistrator i've, in the community vai, being a big believer in patient agency. i've always emphasized and i've always kept her in mind to a vibrant time because, as councilNIEB thigh Information Compliance, Saban gaps in battery Mit intervention on möchten Water ip. ah, soantcers marrow mit where compressions, all that great work is your. where that workation come, I know, was going to get a go nos, having happened a little bit in the same time. so I want to kind of lay me on those odds to on the planning paragraph and then i'd say the next part. where i was, we were shallow. we said distancing fromcko analysis to kinda a passar mind in the doing, But i was. The process has been flawed from the beginning. Taking all of these bills all together has actually diluted the amount that the community has been able to weigh in on each individual bill. And let's not forget that when we took all of these bills to the community over the course of several months- and I credit city planning for the time that they spent with the community- the process was still flawed because we had community homes lumped in together, confusing people, and all they got to hear about, all they really cared about, was mostly at least in the community meetings. I was a part of community homes, which is a totally separate thing, and inclusionary zoning. They didn't get to really weigh in on parking minimums. They didn't really get to hear about and weigh in and have the mental space to think about ADUs. And now we've had this process on one kind of easier to manage, easier to digest bill and I think that's the way to do it. Let's take it one bill at a time, Let's pass this to the next one, Let's get it done today. Let's get it done- It can still be part of the package- and then let's move on to IZ and deal with that, because I can say on the record, I will happily continue to work on IZ, get the bill right and get it done for the city And then let's move on to the next one. So we have ample time on each bill to actually work in community, hear the feedback, continue to work with neighbors, with housing justice advocates, with developers, as we have been, and get it done. But I think it's the right thing to do to get this done today and I will fully commit to continuing to work on IZ after this. I also disagree that this is the thing, this is the nugget that will get IZ over the finish line for developers and their minds. It's not what I'm hearing. I'm hearing that they need financing and that whatever LERDA program we have now is not enough to be able to keep up with the rising cost of building. to keep up with now we have tariffs that we're dealing with. It's expensive to build. We need more gap financing to help. contrary to what we had in Lawrenceville in the Strip District- very hot markets. we need more financing to be able to get those over the finish line and that's what I'm gonna be laser focused on in getting some sort of bill over the finish line with council members and with others on future IZ bill. So wanted to state that I'm supportive of moving forward with this today personally and think it can still be part of an omnibus package, even if it's split up into individual bills. Rhetorically it can still hang together. Thank you, We'll move on to second round. I know that Council Member Warwick had her hand up and maybe others as well. I'd like second round as well. thank you, Sorry, what was that, Councilwoman? I'd like second round as well. Thank you, thank you, okay. Yeah, so just quick. I mean Councilwoman, I hear what you're saying, but I would say that, given that IZ is the hardest one, that to me would be the one that we should address first. That's the one that everyone is talking about, that is the one that is where we have, where we have, so much debate. So for me that seems like the one that we should tackle. Get that one, because the other one's right. the other ones all seem fairly straightforward. right, The parking minimums, the AD. I know the ADUs are a little tricky, but without the IZ- and I know there's also sort of transit, but without the IZ, I mean that is the crux. right, That is the crux is: do we require, which many cities do, and, by the way, many cities, their IZ process evolves. right, But you gotta take that first step, And so that is why I feel like we should be doing it. I mean, if we are going to break this up, so it isn't a bad idea. right, Like, really, let everybody talk about each one. Why would we not do the one that everyone is the most interested in, the public? I'm not talking about developers, I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about the public. right, who we represent. This is the one that they wanna talk about. right, This is the one where, and again, and I think there was one speaker who really I don't- I don't remember who it was, I sort of picture him, but he said: we don't know- there really, ultimately, is no conclusive data about whether IZ hinders or improves the number of houses. right, like, the data is very unclear. but what we do know about IZ, what we do know is that it ensures that in every large project there are units. there are units that are made available to working class people right, Low to working class people- right, We're talking nurses and teachers and custodians who clean our buildings, right. So when we do these projects in our high density neighborhoods- because that's where IZ applies- right, It's in big buildings of 20 units or more In our high density neighborhoods, where people are working and recreating and doing all that that, the people who are supporting all of that, who are supporting that economy in those neighborhoods, can also live in those neighborhoods. So that's what IZ ultimately is about. And for Councilman Coghill, I know you're stepping away, but one neighborhood that always comes to mind for me- because in my district, to be honest, I don't really have much in terms of, like the IZ zone: right, I don't have a lot of high density space, like in my district: right, There's Squirrel Hill, but it's already highly built up. There's not a lot of room in Squirrel Hill. There's a few spots, right, But there's not a lot of room in Squirrel Hill or along Greenfield Avenue to be building giant buildings, right. But the community I think of the most, and what struck me is that- I know he's on the phone, but is in Beachview where the T goes through right, And I sort of just, you know, not too long ago, took the T out to the South Hills Village Mall And I was like- and it was sort of the first time I'd taken the T that far and out- And I was like, wow, like this is so cool, Like this community, which is, you know, currently a community with, you know, a lot of immigrants, right, It's very much like a working class community right on the T, like, wow, this is right, What a great place to live right on the T. And when we look at Pittsburgh, sort of the future of Pittsburgh, that to me seems like a place like, if you're looking to build, like would be right there, right on the T line, Take the T downtown, like perfect, It's got transit, all of that. But if we did all of these other things, including the transit oriented development, if we don't have the IZ, if we don't have the IZ, if we don't have the IZ, then everything that goes up there is, you know, market rate And of course we all know that doing these kind of, you know, I mean, a luxury building is a building with a swimming pool and, like you know, these sort of low cost amenities that make it so that you can charge a lot more in rent. Right, that's why we have these types of projects that come up. That's why folks don't do- you know, developers don't do- just kind of sort of modest apartments that are just kind of like regular because you can't get as much rent. But if you throw in a pool and like some a nice gym and some other amenities, then wow, now you can charge, like you know, 1500 to 3,000. So that's how you know, that's how you make your money on these like very low costs to build amenities that result in significantly higher rent. So if you take a neighborhood like Beachview, with the T, where I mean that is, there could not be a better place to build than a big apartment in Pittsburgh, right Right on that T line And you don't have any affordability requirements around big projects that go up. because what an ideal place to have a bunch of big buildings, high density, right on that T line, right Where people can, you know, don't need to drive, whatever can come into the city. If you don't have any affordability, then the folks who are living there- now that you know that immigrant, you know, like, you know Latin American population, whatever. it's such a cool neighborhood, now those folks get priced out and you lose that And then you just get your sort of generic, you know generic, kind of Lulu lemon- That's not what you know, what I mean, Just kind of like tech industry- and you lose that. And that's something that you see in other neighborhoods And it's a shame And I feel like we really have an opportunity because we're at the. you know we've already started to do that Some right. There are neighborhoods like East Liberty and a few others a little bit in the South side, where you're kind of losing that that great diversity of economic and, you know, racial, but really economic diversity that makes Pittsburgh so cool. And this IZ will help us preserve that in, you know, as our city grows. And so I just wanted to. I just want because, Councilman, I know you say a lot like I, you know, but you know that's what I. that's where IZ has an effect. It's not in your residential, it's not in your single family residential, right, Like it's not in your Lincoln Place or your Greenfield or whatever That has. no, you can't build 20 unit buildings in those neighborhoods. It's only on these corridors where you allow, you know where high density, you know apartment buildings are allowed to be built. So I just, I think you know, but I just want to make that clear, because when we say citywide IZ- and I think that is actually a flaw in kind of the the language, the marketing around this IZ bill- is this concept of just the word citywide, because it's not citywide meaning you can't just build a 20 unit apartment building plop in the middle of Swiss Helm Park. You can't do it. Swiss Helm Park is a single family residential area. It's a residential neighborhood And the vast majority of our neighborhoods are. this is only for those corridors, right Where we're looking at somewhere like the Strip or Lawrenceville, you know which, you know everyone was to the hot neighborhoods, Everyone wants to live there And I feel like somewhere like Beachview along the T, like that's- if I were to put my money down on Pittsburgh's next hot spot- like to build and grow. it's right there And to me it seems worthwhile putting in a policy that allows the folks who are living there now to also, you know, some opportunity to stay and keep that, keep. you know what's so cool about that neighborhood? you know, keep it there. Anyway, that's I guess I'm rambling now, but that's all for me, Thanks. Thank you, Councilwoman Gross. were you able to join back on? Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Okay, great, Thank you. Right, So I do hear the chair's concern that let's vote through the policies that we know have support. And yet I would ask the five members of this council who voted to keep open a bill they knew was wrong, that did not have popular support and that failed at planning commission, that was a hostile amendment of the inclusionary zoning overlay, to not be hypocritical here then. So let us dispose of the bill that we know is not good language, that we know does not have support, that we know there are not the votes to overturn the negative recommendation from our planning commission, And yet you know they have voted to keep that open as leverage and should not. then, If we are going to have a fulsome discussion, that bill should be disposed And then we can move forward with the discussion for language. that will work. And so that's all I have, Madam Chair. Thank you, Anything further for second round, Councilman Coghill. Thank you, Madam Chair. Well, first of all I just want to respond to you, Councilwoman Warwick, Broadway Avenue and Beachview. there is no room to build. There's no empty, maybe one or two empty lots. We're not looking to like mow the place down and like build up so we could, you know, develop more affordable housing or housing in general. We're looking to keep a good housing stock. that we have, necessarily. But when I think IZ citywide, you know I don't necessarily think of Broadway Avenue and Beachview. I agree with you, It's a great spot. It's a great spot to invest in housing. It doesn't have to be super expensive housing. I think that comes in the way of zoning And I think it comes in a way of cutting the permitting process down and just making it easier for developers to want to take on such a project. I do believe, and I know because I talk to developers all the time, that it's hard enough for me to attract them into my district, let alone making them build two units at cost. It's just. I know everybody thinks developers are billionaires and you know they've got money to burn. But you know most projects are very tight budgets and very little leeway for them to build two affordable units on a 20-unit place. So the capacity is not there to build in Beachview, I will tell you, Unless we start knocking buildings down and putting high-rises there, which I don't think. I'm certainly not in favor of that. I don't think the neighborhood would want to lose our you know kind of charm that we have there. So I don't think that's an option. When I think of an inclusionary zoning getting in the way of development in my district I have a lot of spots like old churches, old schools, big areas, acres of area that are ripe for development Unless- Unless- we mandate them to build 20 or 10% over 20 units. We would love housing in my district. I think there's a big market there for it. I try to talk to developers about it all the time. I think they just want to be in hot markets like Lawrenceville and Bloomfield. And again, I'll say it again and this is the truth, I've voted for inclusionary zoning in those neighborhoods because I felt it needed to pump the brakes on development And I think it's proven to be right. So I'm not looking to pump the brakes on development in my district, I'm looking to start the engine. basically, This will handicap developers and they, I don't think, will even look my way if we mandate that they have inclusionary zoning. So I don't think it's good for development in my district. I respect the other council districts. I try to look to see what you need when we vote for citywide issues such as this, And I vote accordingly. That's why I voted for it. I voted for inclusionary zoning in all the districts or all the neighborhoods that currently exist. I think it works great that way. honestly, whether we're trying to, for my reasons, stunt the growth or just provide more affordable housing, I get that too, And that's great that we can count units that are actually on the market that are affordable housing, But not at the expense of no development. in my district, IZ citywide will ensure that I feel like I won't get in trouble. I'm not going to do that. I feel like I won't get any development. That's just kind of my thought And that comes from many conversations with the developers. I know the market. I'm part of the market, So just my thoughts. I respect other districts. I want to support what you feel was important in your district. I want you to do the same for me too, And that's what I'm asking in this. I wish we could just put this conversation to rest. I think we should just keep it as it is by neighborhood Just makes sense to me And I couldn't agree with you more, Madam Chair, as to let's pass the low hanging fruit now, The things that we are sure of, Because IZ citywide, we are eons. I feel away from getting this passed. I could tell you I will fight it to the end. I know it's not good for my district. So let's pass the things that make sense, that are in front of us, that we all agree on, And then save IZ for last. So I completely disagree with Councilwoman Warwick. Instead of trying to tackle it And then we get nothing done, We will be sitting here two years from now with all these things on the table. Let's pass the things that we are all in agreement with, The things that work for all of our neighborhoods, And, you know, tackle IZ as it comes along. But yeah, I just don't feel it's good for my neighborhood. I wish you all would respect that and vote accordingly for that. So thanks, Thank you. Any further discussion? second round: Seeing none. Councilmember Warwick, I know you had a motion you wish to offer. Yeah, I mean, I was hoping to hold for two weeks so that we can talk about this, you know, more holistically with all the other pieces. Making a motion, Oh, motion to hold for two weeks. Second Further discussion. Can we take a roll call vote on the motion to hold for two weeks, please? Second, Second, Second, Second, Second, Second, Secondcling vote on the motion. Jesus says A Drummond She, ppy, A Drummond Shea, No. Ms Carlson, Tada, Sarah Light, Ms Clark, Ms GEORGAS. So, Kara Soalnya In Second, Mr Watts In Mr Mark In Happen, 3 ayes, 5, noes. Motion fails. So we have a motion to approve on the table. Any further discussion. Seeing none. all those in favor of Bill 1579, Let's take a roll call vote on Bill 1579 in favor of passage.

So on Rule 16-d by-law, 20-3-se, Title N. 9 Zoning, Article 2: Based Zoning Districts, Chapter 903- Residential Zoning Districts to Reduce Required Minimum L loafs gözl-in Motion to approve the discussion. second First Brother, as to what this bill does, what the concerns are, and want to thank this body for for taking up this bill, to discuss it and hopefully pass it, because what i believe you know this bill does is is a lot and, quite frankly, you know it's something that i'm quite kind of embarrassed that back in 2020, when i got an office, it wasn't the first bill that i introduced or worked on, because you know, a bill like this it's it's being touted as i know it's being touted as a bill that solves the problems of iz that some you know to make it work, inclusionary zoning iz, but though may be the case for for units that are above 20, but just recently there was a variance that was denied for five units in the city and this, this bill would solve that. i know there's concerns, that you know, developers just make money and the lawyers represent them to make money. but quite frankly, the everyone in the business makes more money when we have more restrictive laws. they just quite they. they get more money when there's court cases on variants. so you know, i i don't think this is, you know, the answer to making iz work. we all know that to make inclusion or zoning work, there's, there's a lot of work to do currently in lawrenceville, right with the current, recent current projects there, and those don't pencil out unless, well, only if, there's ratification of the housing Action code for rent at the distinct section. is Considering this coming out in fairest of its formation footage required to build on a lot, nothing more. contextual setbacks, height limits and other protections remain in place. this change helps us unlock vacant land, all the work that we do at the land bank. every time we celebrate the land bank we are celebrating, you know, the great work they do, but we could be doing so much more. and you know this bill really provides an opportunity for all families, especially working families, to, you know, make housing more affordable, more accessible and it's just a better use of our neighborhoods instead of making abandoned, you know, parcels in between houses. so it's time to- i believe it's time to get this done and i'm proud to move forward today. thank you, council person warwick. yeah, thanks, so you know. just a few thoughts. obviously, this- i don't believe this- was on the agenda until about 10 minutes before the meeting started, which, you know, given that we had a public hearing that was clearly, you know, divide. you know the public is divided, at least if we're basing it on that hearing. we had about half of the people who are very concerned about affordable housing and inclusionary zoning, who are in favor of this bill but want to see it, you know, come to fruition, together with the requirements that units- you know that projects with 20 units or more have 10 of those units reserved as affordable so that we can, you know, create neighborhoods that are for folks of all income levels. so, and then the other half, of course, where our our yimby folks, who you know are anti-iz, no matter which way you slice it. so i think that sort of slipping this in quickly before a meeting, the morning after a major natural disaster is an interesting choice. that said, you know, as far as the bill itself, i agree this is a good bill. that is why, you know, almost immediately when i came to office, and all these same folks right are, are pro-housing pittsburgh folks, architects, developers, etc. you know when we were, you know, saying we need zoning reform and this was one of the number one issues that my team sat down with all these folks to: to craft, craft this legislation and then and then have it and and then, you know, press for the administration to include it in the housing, in the, in the, in the package. so again, you know- i've said this over and over again- we clearly have two views. there's there's the view that that we should, you know, just do everything we can to allow developers to build as much as they want, wherever they want. and and, by the way, there is, we do have a tax abatement for affordability. so if you choose to do affordability, whether it's in the iz district now or just in general, you get an abatement for that, i believe. so, so, so there is, i'll, you know, i'll let councilwoman gross speak to that, i'm sure, if she's online, but at any rate, i just feel like you know, we do have a public hearing coming up about councilman charlotte's bill in a couple of weeks, i believe, and you know, i just i really feel that this needs to be. i, i am, i am a big fan of this bill. i i, you know, my team and i worked to write this and put it into the housing needs assessment package. i i'm i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to do that, but i'm, i am very dismayed that, as sort of the, the, the major incentive, the one thing that the developer community wanted, you know, in good faith, my team and i worked to get this in because it is important we do need to be able to build more. you know we shouldn't be restricting our you know how many units we can build. you know this bill makes sense, but it also is sort of the, the carrots, so to speak. that will help. i think in this bill, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the design of the bill is included as part of our mindset and is kind of- you knowSteer'smmiss essere, that is nfestan, is kind of revolutionary. you know, taking, conspiring Agora, owohh, both goals, if you want, OiI, that's not really, you know, the many pillar A, the no, but also My, do think, definitely do neighborhoods like we have in the Strip, where it's just, you know, playground for wealthy tech folks to actually create, you know, use those neighborhoods to create mixed income communities like we have in Pittsburgh. because that's what's so, that's what's so great about Pittsburgh is it is this city where you can, you know, you can- be a Google exec and go to a, you know, go to a bar or go to a party and be, you know, hanging out with people who are, you know, from all walks of life, doing all different kinds of jobs, whether they're a roofer or whatever. That's what I love about my neighborhood. But you know, yeah, I'm just, I'm obviously a big fan of this bill. It's very good, it's a good bill, But I'm very dismayed to see it move forward without this, this council, working to make sure that lower income and working folks also have a piece and that our market rate developers also play a part in creating affordable housing in our city, because our taxpayers are certainly playing a role. Our taxpayers, you know, our money, taxpayer, dollars. everybody in the city of Pittsburgh is paying a lot in order to make sure that we can keep this city affordable, And I feel that our market rate developers should be participating in that. There are lots of ways for them to do that using public dollars. And this was the real juicy thing. This was the thing they wanted, This was the biggest thing they wanted. I know there's like the parking stuff and there's the ADUs, you know, but this was the, this was the. you know, this was the big prize And yeah, anyway, I think it's, I think it's unfortunate that we're not doing them both together, Which is how, how the housing needs assessment package was brought to us And now it's, it's being sort of broken up bit by bit. Anyway, I've, I've said this all before and I'll just I'll leave, All right. Well, I would like to do a motion to hold for two weeks, just to kind of let folks weigh in. I'll put that on the table, if I can. We have I'm, I'm going to ask that you hold your motion to hold, let others say their piece, We can do a motion to hold and then we'll take a vote and then we'll, yeah, move from there. Okay, Yeah, So we have Councilman Coghill and then I know Councilwoman Gross is online. wish to speak? Thank you, Thank you, Madam Chair. Well, I will say this: It sounds like all parties are in agreement that this is a good thing. I am as well. I think to me it's. I'm a firm believer in order to increase housing of all sorts. Including affordable is through zoning, not through mandatory action to include inclusionary zoning with developers. When you start subdividing lots and lose parking requirements, it makes it affordable to that general contractor to come in and build two, whether it be tiny homes or whatever. So so I don't think that's in dispute as far as like who agrees with the, the bill that's in front of us today. It sounds like everybody agrees with it. I am not looking at this bill as leverage where I feel like maybe you are, Councilman, Councilwoman Warwick, toward getting IZ in there, Maybe the developers gave you that impression or somebody give you that impression, but I'm adamantly against inclusionary zoning. So this to me, is the direction, And thank you, Councilman Wilson, for pushing the conversation to where it should be, I feel, in zoning and planning And, you know, making it easier for people to build, So so, so with that, yeah, I'm in full support. I don't see any reason to hold this up when everybody's in agreement and it's at least doing action where the other two bills. you know this will eventually be a part of whether it be Councilman Charlene's bill, the administration's bill or a combination of both, but this belongs in either, or so I see no reason in holding up. So thank you, And thank you, Councilman Wilson, for you know, for your time. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, but but that you know, I'm still in that process. I'm still in, you know, working on this issue. Thank you, Council. Councilwoman gross, Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you Appreciate it. so I just want members to understand that there have been apartment buildings at 350 total units completed under the Ozzy and Lawrenceville. There's another 267 near construction units completion in the IZ in Lawrenceville. There are 20 unit projects near completion in the IZ in Lawrenceville- And I'm working on my phone and I think I could actually make that number longer. There's a building which you can drive by and see on Melwood, outside of Post Hill in the Oakland IZ, which is gosh, at least 10 stories tall, nearly completed in the IZ. So members who don't have any inclusionary zoning in their districts, who don't see the buildings right in front of them that have inclusionary zoning units maybe should not make assumptions about projects in the inclusionary zoning districts Moving on to minimum lot size. Absolutely, this is something that is makes sense for a lot of reasons. I agree that on the small parcels- it's what some people call the lots, parts of my district, the townhouses or the tiny single family homes that were built 100 years ago on narrow streets and tiny lots to be close to trolley lines were built without a minimum lot size and without setbacks, basically from the edge of the parcel. So I'm entirely supportive. I do also want to remind council members again who do not have any inclusionary zoning in their districts that every project that includes 10% at 50% affordable- which is what is proposed to go beyond Bloomfield, Polishell, Lawrenceville and Oakland, where it is now to move beyond that- automatically qualifies for an additional 60 feet of height. if you do not do 10% at 50% AMI of the units, you don't get a bonus two floors of apartments, right. so imagine you're on a site where it allows you to do five floors of apartments you opt to do. you can opt to do it now. you could opt to do it now. it's outside. you could opt to do it now and left side, 10%. at 50% ami, you automatically get two more floors and, trust me, on large sites that can be another 80 units. these are very large buildings. that is in place right now. you also get Alerdea that this council, before you served on it, put in place. that allows for up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of tax abatement per year for 10, for 10 years. so I think those are already bonuses that are in place. there is no reason to rush this through because this imaginary suggestion, right this, this kind of false suggestion that this is going to unlock projects that aren't penciling right now. this council has already, over the years, put bonuses in place that are there already on the books and that developers use. so I also think that that this discussion should be. it is part of the package that some members of council have blocked for council discussion and I would rather take it up when we can take up the other package. I think it makes sense as part of the other package. it's it's not bad language, just councilwoman Warwick's office wrote it. I support the language, but it is meant to be a part of a bigger, more impactful housing reform. so I support. thank you. that's all I'm sure. thank you. is there any further discussion? first round: okay, I will say no. yeah, oh sorry, no worries, please, please proceed. council president, thank you, sorry I couldn't be there in person today. power, PPS not peeing and PPS being closed, etc. etc. so, towards everyone else's comments, I'm supportive of the bill. so I'll say that upfront. but I am torn as we sit here today on whether or not, if we chose to vote this today, would I actually support it. and it's not about the bill, it is about the process. councilman Wilson mentioned all the speakers who came down for the public hearing a week ago, probably two to one those speakers. what they said were, yes, we all support this bill, but we want to have the fuller conversation. we want to have this conversation in context with all the other things. and while, yes, each bill that is sort of talked about as the quote-unquote package are independent bills, so we can't absolutely take them independently- I want to be clear about that- it doesn't mean that we shouldn't be having the fuller conversation, which is what was asked of us. unfortunately, we're not having the fuller conversation because council voted to hold a bill, an IZ bill- for six weeks. that I believe comes back up for discussion next week and we can't have the fuller conversation until we deal with that, and so it would be my preference to not vote this until we have disposed or voted in some capacity on that bill that will come up for discussion next week. that will then allow for us to begin talking about the full conversation of: yes, isia. yes, minimum lot size. yes, accessory dwelling units. yes, parking requirements- restricting parking requirements- that various members have worked on dead. obviously, i'm not sorry. i'm sorry, barb obviously initially worked on this bill. i know, councilman strassberger, you've worked on the parking stuff a lot and we've all had our own various opinions, but we're not having the full conversation which i think we should, which is what the public asked us to do. so i would support the two-week hole so that we can next week have the iz bill before us, which needs held for a public hearing. so if the, if, the, if there's a need, the motion to hold for two weeks, i'll be certainly supportive of that. i'm torn on how i would actually vote today, because what i heard loud and clear was: yes, we want you to do this. no, there's no rush to get this done today. we can hold it for a couple weeks, in my personal opinion, dispose of a bill that will require seven members to vote for it. there's definitely not seven members that are going to vote for it. i can tell that with absolute certainty- and then move this bill and the other bills forward, whether those are as individual bills or whether they're all on the table at the same time. that's the conversation we can collectively have, but i think that's the most prudent thing to do, thank you, thank you all. right, we'll go to second round in a minute. i'm going to make some remarks first. so first i do want to thank, of course, councilman wilson for bringing this up and for his work on this, but i want to thank council person warwick mccarım and the community back and forth on this. prior to this, i do want to thank the mem prochain because she's been so present and as a physician and economistrator i've, in the community vai, being a big believer in patient agency. i've always emphasized and i've always kept her in mind to a vibrant time because, as councilNIEB thigh Information Compliance, Saban gaps in battery Mit intervention on möchten Water ip. ah, soantcers marrow mit where compressions, all that great work is your. where that workation come, I know, was going to get a go nos, having happened a little bit in the same time. so I want to kind of lay me on those odds to on the planning paragraph and then i'd say the next part. where i was, we were shallow. we said distancing fromcko analysis to kinda a passar mind in the doing, But i was. The process has been flawed from the beginning. Taking all of these bills all together has actually diluted the amount that the community has been able to weigh in on each individual bill. And let's not forget that when we took all of these bills to the community over the course of several months- and I credit city planning for the time that they spent with the community- the process was still flawed because we had community homes lumped in together, confusing people, and all they got to hear about, all they really cared about, was mostly at least in the community meetings. I was a part of community homes, which is a totally separate thing, and inclusionary zoning. They didn't get to really weigh in on parking minimums. They didn't really get to hear about and weigh in and have the mental space to think about ADUs. And now we've had this process on one kind of easier to manage, easier to digest bill and I think that's the way to do it. Let's take it one bill at a time, Let's pass this to the next one, Let's get it done today. Let's get it done- It can still be part of the package- and then let's move on to IZ and deal with that, because I can say on the record, I will happily continue to work on IZ, get the bill right and get it done for the city And then let's move on to the next one. So we have ample time on each bill to actually work in community, hear the feedback, continue to work with neighbors, with housing justice advocates, with developers, as we have been, and get it done. But I think it's the right thing to do to get this done today and I will fully commit to continuing to work on IZ after this. I also disagree that this is the thing, this is the nugget that will get IZ over the finish line for developers and their minds. It's not what I'm hearing. I'm hearing that they need financing and that whatever LERDA program we have now is not enough to be able to keep up with the rising cost of building. to keep up with now we have tariffs that we're dealing with. It's expensive to build. We need more gap financing to help. contrary to what we had in Lawrenceville in the Strip District- very hot markets. we need more financing to be able to get those over the finish line and that's what I'm gonna be laser focused on in getting some sort of bill over the finish line with council members and with others on future IZ bill. So wanted to state that I'm supportive of moving forward with this today personally and think it can still be part of an omnibus package, even if it's split up into individual bills. Rhetorically it can still hang together. Thank you, We'll move on to second round. I know that Council Member Warwick had her hand up and maybe others as well. I'd like second round as well. thank you, Sorry, what was that, Councilwoman? I'd like second round as well. Thank you, thank you, okay. Yeah, so just quick. I mean Councilwoman, I hear what you're saying, but I would say that, given that IZ is the hardest one, that to me would be the one that we should address first. That's the one that everyone is talking about, that is the one that is where we have, where we have, so much debate. So for me that seems like the one that we should tackle. Get that one, because the other one's right. the other ones all seem fairly straightforward. right, The parking minimums, the AD. I know the ADUs are a little tricky, but without the IZ- and I know there's also sort of transit, but without the IZ, I mean that is the crux. right, That is the crux is: do we require, which many cities do, and, by the way, many cities, their IZ process evolves. right, But you gotta take that first step, And so that is why I feel like we should be doing it. I mean, if we are going to break this up, so it isn't a bad idea. right, Like, really, let everybody talk about each one. Why would we not do the one that everyone is the most interested in, the public? I'm not talking about developers, I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about the public. right, who we represent. This is the one that they wanna talk about. right, This is the one where, and again, and I think there was one speaker who really I don't- I don't remember who it was, I sort of picture him, but he said: we don't know- there really, ultimately, is no conclusive data about whether IZ hinders or improves the number of houses. right, like, the data is very unclear. but what we do know about IZ, what we do know is that it ensures that in every large project there are units. there are units that are made available to working class people right, Low to working class people- right, We're talking nurses and teachers and custodians who clean our buildings, right. So when we do these projects in our high density neighborhoods- because that's where IZ applies- right, It's in big buildings of 20 units or more In our high density neighborhoods, where people are working and recreating and doing all that that, the people who are supporting all of that, who are supporting that economy in those neighborhoods, can also live in those neighborhoods. So that's what IZ ultimately is about. And for Councilman Coghill, I know you're stepping away, but one neighborhood that always comes to mind for me- because in my district, to be honest, I don't really have much in terms of, like the IZ zone: right, I don't have a lot of high density space, like in my district: right, There's Squirrel Hill, but it's already highly built up. There's not a lot of room in Squirrel Hill. There's a few spots, right, But there's not a lot of room in Squirrel Hill or along Greenfield Avenue to be building giant buildings, right. But the community I think of the most, and what struck me is that- I know he's on the phone, but is in Beachview where the T goes through right, And I sort of just, you know, not too long ago, took the T out to the South Hills Village Mall And I was like- and it was sort of the first time I'd taken the T that far and out- And I was like, wow, like this is so cool, Like this community, which is, you know, currently a community with, you know, a lot of immigrants, right, It's very much like a working class community right on the T, like, wow, this is right, What a great place to live right on the T. And when we look at Pittsburgh, sort of the future of Pittsburgh, that to me seems like a place like, if you're looking to build, like would be right there, right on the T line, Take the T downtown, like perfect, It's got transit, all of that. But if we did all of these other things, including the transit oriented development, if we don't have the IZ, if we don't have the IZ, if we don't have the IZ, then everything that goes up there is, you know, market rate And of course we all know that doing these kind of, you know, I mean, a luxury building is a building with a swimming pool and, like you know, these sort of low cost amenities that make it so that you can charge a lot more in rent. Right, that's why we have these types of projects that come up. That's why folks don't do- you know, developers don't do- just kind of sort of modest apartments that are just kind of like regular because you can't get as much rent. But if you throw in a pool and like some a nice gym and some other amenities, then wow, now you can charge, like you know, 1500 to 3,000. So that's how you know, that's how you make your money on these like very low costs to build amenities that result in significantly higher rent. So if you take a neighborhood like Beachview, with the T, where I mean that is, there could not be a better place to build than a big apartment in Pittsburgh, right Right on that T line And you don't have any affordability requirements around big projects that go up. because what an ideal place to have a bunch of big buildings, high density, right on that T line, right Where people can, you know, don't need to drive, whatever can come into the city. If you don't have any affordability, then the folks who are living there- now that you know that immigrant, you know, like, you know Latin American population, whatever. it's such a cool neighborhood, now those folks get priced out and you lose that And then you just get your sort of generic, you know generic, kind of Lulu lemon- That's not what you know, what I mean, Just kind of like tech industry- and you lose that. And that's something that you see in other neighborhoods And it's a shame And I feel like we really have an opportunity because we're at the. you know we've already started to do that Some right. There are neighborhoods like East Liberty and a few others a little bit in the South side, where you're kind of losing that that great diversity of economic and, you know, racial, but really economic diversity that makes Pittsburgh so cool. And this IZ will help us preserve that in, you know, as our city grows. And so I just wanted to. I just want because, Councilman, I know you say a lot like I, you know, but you know that's what I. that's where IZ has an effect. It's not in your residential, it's not in your single family residential, right, Like it's not in your Lincoln Place or your Greenfield or whatever That has. no, you can't build 20 unit buildings in those neighborhoods. It's only on these corridors where you allow, you know where high density, you know apartment buildings are allowed to be built. So I just, I think you know, but I just want to make that clear, because when we say citywide IZ- and I think that is actually a flaw in kind of the the language, the marketing around this IZ bill- is this concept of just the word citywide, because it's not citywide meaning you can't just build a 20 unit apartment building plop in the middle of Swiss Helm Park. You can't do it. Swiss Helm Park is a single family residential area. It's a residential neighborhood And the vast majority of our neighborhoods are. this is only for those corridors, right Where we're looking at somewhere like the Strip or Lawrenceville, you know which, you know everyone was to the hot neighborhoods, Everyone wants to live there And I feel like somewhere like Beachview along the T, like that's- if I were to put my money down on Pittsburgh's next hot spot- like to build and grow. it's right there And to me it seems worthwhile putting in a policy that allows the folks who are living there now to also, you know, some opportunity to stay and keep that, keep. you know what's so cool about that neighborhood? you know, keep it there. Anyway, that's I guess I'm rambling now, but that's all for me, Thanks. Thank you, Councilwoman Gross. were you able to join back on? Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Okay, great, Thank you. Right, So I do hear the chair's concern that let's vote through the policies that we know have support. And yet I would ask the five members of this council who voted to keep open a bill they knew was wrong, that did not have popular support and that failed at planning commission, that was a hostile amendment of the inclusionary zoning overlay, to not be hypocritical here then. So let us dispose of the bill that we know is not good language, that we know does not have support, that we know there are not the votes to overturn the negative recommendation from our planning commission, And yet you know they have voted to keep that open as leverage and should not. then, If we are going to have a fulsome discussion, that bill should be disposed And then we can move forward with the discussion for language. that will work. And so that's all I have, Madam Chair. Thank you, Anything further for second round, Councilman Coghill. Thank you, Madam Chair. Well, first of all I just want to respond to you, Councilwoman Warwick, Broadway Avenue and Beachview. there is no room to build. There's no empty, maybe one or two empty lots. We're not looking to like mow the place down and like build up so we could, you know, develop more affordable housing or housing in general. We're looking to keep a good housing stock. that we have, necessarily. But when I think IZ citywide, you know I don't necessarily think of Broadway Avenue and Beachview. I agree with you, It's a great spot. It's a great spot to invest in housing. It doesn't have to be super expensive housing. I think that comes in the way of zoning And I think it comes in a way of cutting the permitting process down and just making it easier for developers to want to take on such a project. I do believe, and I know because I talk to developers all the time, that it's hard enough for me to attract them into my district, let alone making them build two units at cost. It's just. I know everybody thinks developers are billionaires and you know they've got money to burn. But you know most projects are very tight budgets and very little leeway for them to build two affordable units on a 20-unit place. So the capacity is not there to build in Beachview, I will tell you, Unless we start knocking buildings down and putting high-rises there, which I don't think. I'm certainly not in favor of that. I don't think the neighborhood would want to lose our you know kind of charm that we have there. So I don't think that's an option. When I think of an inclusionary zoning getting in the way of development in my district I have a lot of spots like old churches, old schools, big areas, acres of area that are ripe for development Unless- Unless- we mandate them to build 20 or 10% over 20 units. We would love housing in my district. I think there's a big market there for it. I try to talk to developers about it all the time. I think they just want to be in hot markets like Lawrenceville and Bloomfield. And again, I'll say it again and this is the truth, I've voted for inclusionary zoning in those neighborhoods because I felt it needed to pump the brakes on development And I think it's proven to be right. So I'm not looking to pump the brakes on development in my district, I'm looking to start the engine. basically, This will handicap developers and they, I don't think, will even look my way if we mandate that they have inclusionary zoning. So I don't think it's good for development in my district. I respect the other council districts. I try to look to see what you need when we vote for citywide issues such as this, And I vote accordingly. That's why I voted for it. I voted for inclusionary zoning in all the districts or all the neighborhoods that currently exist. I think it works great that way. honestly, whether we're trying to, for my reasons, stunt the growth or just provide more affordable housing, I get that too, And that's great that we can count units that are actually on the market that are affordable housing, But not at the expense of no development. in my district, IZ citywide will ensure that I feel like I won't get in trouble. I'm not going to do that. I feel like I won't get any development. That's just kind of my thought And that comes from many conversations with the developers. I know the market. I'm part of the market, So just my thoughts. I respect other districts. I want to support what you feel was important in your district. I want you to do the same for me too, And that's what I'm asking in this. I wish we could just put this conversation to rest. I think we should just keep it as it is by neighborhood Just makes sense to me And I couldn't agree with you more, Madam Chair, as to let's pass the low hanging fruit now, The things that we are sure of, Because IZ citywide, we are eons. I feel away from getting this passed. I could tell you I will fight it to the end. I know it's not good for my district. So let's pass the things that make sense, that are in front of us, that we all agree on, And then save IZ for last. So I completely disagree with Councilwoman Warwick.

• **The changes cut lot size requirements significantly:**
  - Very low-density areas: reduced from 8,000 to 6,000 square feet
  - Low-density areas: reduced from 5,000 to 3,000 square feet  
  - Moderate-density areas: reduced from 3,200 to 2,400 square feet
  - High-density areas: reduced from 1,800 to 1,200 square feet

• **The bill passed with a 5-1 vote**, with one council member voting no and two abstaining. Council Member Wilson sponsored the legislation.

• **Supporters said the changes will help unlock vacant land** and make housing more affordable by allowing development on smaller lots throughout the city.

• **Some council members wanted to delay the vote** to discuss it alongside other housing bills, including inclusionary zoning requirements. A motion to hold the bill for two weeks failed by a 5-4 vote.

• **The legislation keeps other building rules in place**, including height limits and setback requirements from property lines.

• **Council members disagreed about timing**, with some arguing all housing-related bills should be considered together, while others wanted to pass individual measures that had broad support.

• **The changes affect how developers can subdivide lots** but don't change what types of buildings can be built in different neighborhoods."

Yes, All right, Looking forward to that discussion. Yes, Appreciate it, Thank you. Thank you, I don't know who. I saw Councilman Cawkill, followed by Councilperson Warwick. You go first Ladies. Well, so I just wanted, because I of course have, as you know, I have the Christopher Columbus statue in my district, which is another statue, that is, you know, I'm not sure if you've seen it, but it's a statue of a man who was killed in the war, Right, And it's a statue. that is quite so, I guess I'm curious, where are we? and the Columbus one is significantly larger, I believe, correct, Correct- Than the Stephen Foster one, Correct.

Oh, So if anything is damaged, we know the value of the statue to be reimbursed.

I know that, but I mean: why are we paying? Why don't they pay for it? Why is it any cost to us whatsoever? Good question, and I can bring that up in the contract: How much would that cost? Do we know? Approximately? 600, 600, 600 is 600. I mean when you're- Yeah, When we could just leave it in a warehouse with no cost. So I'll abstain today, I guess. but I'd like for that museum.

• Pittsburgh City Council approved loaning the city-owned Stephen Foster statue to the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles for about one year at no cost to the city

• The statue is currently stored in a crate at a Department of Public Works yard in Highland Park after being removed from public display

• MOCA will pay all transportation costs to ship the statue to Los Angeles for a special exhibit about decommissioned artwork from across the country

• The city's only expense will be about $600 to hire an auditor to assess the statue's value for insurance purposes in case it gets damaged

• After the exhibit ends in about a year, the statue will be returned to Pittsburgh, giving the city time to decide what to do with it permanently through a citywide discussion

• One council member questioned why the city should pay the $600 auditor fee instead of having the museum cover all costs, and abstained from voting

• The statue was described by one council member as ""pretty terrible"" and is part of ongoing discussions about how to handle controversial public art that has been removed"

Pittsburgh. Okay, The Pittsburgh City Code, Title 10 Building, Chapter 1004- International Property Maintenance. Code Adoption, Section 1004. 02: changes specified to allow for the planting and maintenance of managed natural landscapes by residents. Thank you, Council Member Warwick. Yeah, so just quickly, because again I would like to hold for for two weeks. PLI had some had some last minute things that they wanted to clarify, But essentially this bill would allow residents who want to create, you know grow, managed natural landscape which is like rain gardens or pollinator gardens or you know whatnot, to to be able to register those with PLI so that they don't have the issue of folks calling them in you know thinking that their gardens are you know weeds and overgrowth and whatnot. So to register those and then that way it just sort of cuts down on well, also, and and just getting you know if, if, if someone isn't sure and and you know files a, a, 311, that that PLI can then see that that it is a, that it's a registered natural landscape, and we can talk more about it. I'm happy to answer any questions, but this sort of came out of. there was a a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a city paper article a while back that sort of raised this issue of folks were getting we're getting PL, you know, we're getting violations, and having to come and sort of you know go back and forth with PLI when they were really just doing a, a garden, because these don't look like your typical flower garden, that which which is also allowed, Right, But it doesn't look like your typical sort of classic flower garden. So it was just a to kind of ease that process a little bit, little bit for folks. I'm happy to answer any, any questions. thank you, yeah, I think we had council person Sharla next. yeah, I, I guess I guess what I'm asking to ask for is in her derogatory. but this: I had a similar discussion when we started to talk about quality of life ticketing, mm-hmm, I believe actually was from your constituents. that really reached out to us. it's not, this is not something that happens. you know in my part of town very much, but the the concern was that I guess the way that we were looking at this was that we needed to talk to one of the agriculture experts, kind of about what to what would qualify. my concern right now is, as we have entered the growing season, I, this morning drive, drove through Pius Street, mm-hmm, and there's, you know, property that they're trying to build and there's you know, foot tall grass already on there. what's stopping them from saying, oh, we're just naturalizing the yard here, well so, yeah, well, so, first of all, when you register, right, you have to, there's like because there's native plants, right. so you, you indicate what you're growing, right. so it's a little more to it than just saying, yeah, I mean, I think it's a little more to it than just saying that you know, there's a lot of things that are still in the natural landscape and there are still rules, right, like, it can't be blocking the right-of-way, it can't be, it can't have issues with rodents. I mean, there's things that that are still baked in so that if someone is being devious and using this as a as an excuse to not maintain their property, then that would be that could be addressed by PLI. art grass and weeds, native plants- I, you know, I will have to look at. I am NOT a gardener myself, but I I knew that, not to use the pun, but this becomes a very thorny issue when we look at this. I mean, it was like three years ago, I guess. it quality of life, ticketing of, like you know, Penn State agriculture reached out to us and they had some suggestions. but you know, I understand the desire to do this. I'm also worried about the. I understand the desire to do this. I'm also worried about the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, and thought a lot. I mean, yeah, there have been a lot of ways that we've needle water. I mean, yeah, wrong, we're veryème an interesting idea. i would say that that would be something that we could address if we saw it happen. right, because we do have folks who want to do these gardens and they're good for the environment, right, they're good for you know, they get with storm water and and all of that and, you know, just overall good for the city. so if we were to see that and if we were to see, like you know, slumlords registering- although i don't, i mean, let's see if they register their apartments with the, with the rental registry, and then register their, their yards, as pollinator gardens, but if we do see that, that would seem like something that we could address. now you're really getting into the weeds. the weeds, yeah, thank you. all right, thank you, but at any rate, i would like to hold a motion to hold if, if there's any further discussion, you have to answer questions. second, second discussion on the on the motion for a two-week hold. two-week hold, yeah, please. yeah, i just wanted to say i'm in full support. thank you for your work on this, thank you for including me as a co-sponsor, and it's timely because i know that there's also this movement that started, i think, in the uk called no mo may, where people are encouraged just not not to know their lawns in may when the wildflowers are coming up, and then they kind of create their own little pollinator gardens and then you can make it, you can mow it in june, so it doesn't get too out of control. so i've always wanted to get that going as well. i know it's hard because we have to really get it. that that's the word out to people and to neighbors and to 3-1-1 and to pli, but that would be a really neat thing to get off the ground as well. i i do want to say one thing for anybody who is worried about this is i i am not a gardener and my mother was a gardener and she used to like the english garden style, which is like just crazy flowers everywhere, and i used to get to the house when i was a kid. you had to like go through the rose bushes and whatever. so i i am very cognizant that people do not want to have to do that. right, they do not want to be walking down the sidewalk and, you know, having wet, you know this net hitting them in the face. that's something i don't like too. so i do want to make it clear that that's not what. this is right. you still need to keep it, keep it together, keep it on your property, and this is just so that folks can, you know, register it and let the city know that that is what they're doing. okay, any further discussion on a two-week hold. seeing none. all those in favor of a two-week hold of bill bills 1770 and 1771, please indicate by saying aye, aye, aye. bills will be held for two weeks.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

Bill 1771 Ordinance amending that. Pittsburgh. Okay, The Pittsburgh City Code, Title 10 Building, Chapter 1004- International Property Maintenance. Code Adoption, Section 1004. 02: changes specified to allow for the planting and maintenance of managed natural landscapes by residents. Thank you, Council Member Warwick. Yeah, so just quickly, because again I would like to hold for for two weeks. PLI had some had some last minute things that they wanted to clarify, But essentially this bill would allow residents who want to create, you know grow, managed natural landscape which is like rain gardens or pollinator gardens or you know whatnot, to to be able to register those with PLI so that they don't have the issue of folks calling them in you know thinking that their gardens are you know weeds and overgrowth and whatnot. So to register those and then that way it just sort of cuts down on well, also, and and just getting you know if, if, if someone isn't sure and and you know files a, a, 311, that that PLI can then see that that it is a, that it's a registered natural landscape, and we can talk more about it. I'm happy to answer any questions, but this sort of came out of. there was a a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a city paper article a while back that sort of raised this issue of folks were getting we're getting PL, you know, we're getting violations, and having to come and sort of you know go back and forth with PLI when they were really just doing a, a garden, because these don't look like your typical flower garden, that which which is also allowed, Right, But it doesn't look like your typical sort of classic flower garden. So it was just a to kind of ease that process a little bit, little bit for folks. I'm happy to answer any, any questions. thank you, yeah, I think we had council person Sharla next. yeah, I, I guess I guess what I'm asking to ask for is in her derogatory. but this: I had a similar discussion when we started to talk about quality of life ticketing, mm-hmm, I believe actually was from your constituents. that really reached out to us. it's not, this is not something that happens. you know in my part of town very much, but the the concern was that I guess the way that we were looking at this was that we needed to talk to one of the agriculture experts, kind of about what to what would qualify. my concern right now is, as we have entered the growing season, I, this morning drive, drove through Pius Street, mm-hmm, and there's, you know, property that they're trying to build and there's you know, foot tall grass already on there. what's stopping them from saying, oh, we're just naturalizing the yard here, well so, yeah, well, so, first of all, when you register, right, you have to, there's like because there's native plants, right. so you, you indicate what you're growing, right. so it's a little more to it than just saying, yeah, I mean, I think it's a little more to it than just saying that you know, there's a lot of things that are still in the natural landscape and there are still rules, right, like, it can't be blocking the right-of-way, it can't be, it can't have issues with rodents. I mean, there's things that that are still baked in so that if someone is being devious and using this as a as an excuse to not maintain their property, then that would be that could be addressed by PLI. art grass and weeds, native plants- I, you know, I will have to look at. I am NOT a gardener myself, but I I knew that, not to use the pun, but this becomes a very thorny issue when we look at this. I mean, it was like three years ago, I guess. it quality of life, ticketing of, like you know, Penn State agriculture reached out to us and they had some suggestions. but you know, I understand the desire to do this. I'm also worried about the. I understand the desire to do this. I'm also worried about the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, and thought a lot. I mean, yeah, there have been a lot of ways that we've needle water. I mean, yeah, wrong, we're veryème an interesting idea. i would say that that would be something that we could address if we saw it happen. right, because we do have folks who want to do these gardens and they're good for the environment, right, they're good for you know, they get with storm water and and all of that and, you know, just overall good for the city. so if we were to see that and if we were to see, like you know, slumlords registering- although i don't, i mean, let's see if they register their apartments with the, with the rental registry, and then register their, their yards, as pollinator gardens, but if we do see that, that would seem like something that we could address. now you're really getting into the weeds. the weeds, yeah, thank you. all right, thank you, but at any rate, i would like to hold a motion to hold if, if there's any further discussion, you have to answer questions. second, second discussion on the on the motion for a two-week hold. two-week hold, yeah, please. yeah, i just wanted to say i'm in full support. thank you for your work on this, thank you for including me as a co-sponsor, and it's timely because i know that there's also this movement that started, i think, in the uk called no mo may, where people are encouraged just not not to know their lawns in may when the wildflowers are coming up, and then they kind of create their own little pollinator gardens and then you can make it, you can mow it in june, so it doesn't get too out of control. so i've always wanted to get that going as well. i know it's hard because we have to really get it. that that's the word out to people and to neighbors and to 3-1-1 and to pli, but that would be a really neat thing to get off the ground as well. i i do want to say one thing for anybody who is worried about this is i i am not a gardener and my mother was a gardener and she used to like the english garden style, which is like just crazy flowers everywhere, and i used to get to the house when i was a kid. you had to like go through the rose bushes and whatever. so i i am very cognizant that people do not want to have to do that. right, they do not want to be walking down the sidewalk and, you know, having wet, you know this net hitting them in the face. that's something i don't like too. so i do want to make it clear that that's not what. this is right. you still need to keep it, keep it together, keep it on your property, and this is just so that folks can, you know, register it and let the city know that that is what they're doing. okay, any further discussion on a two-week hold. seeing none. all those in favor of a two-week hold of bill bills 1770 and 1771, please indicate by saying aye, aye, aye. bills will be held for two weeks.",Pittsburgh City Council delays vote on ordinance that would let residents register natural gardens to avoid weed violations.,"• Pittsburgh City Council delayed voting on an ordinance that would let residents register ""managed natural landscapes"" like rain gardens and pollinator gardens with the city

• The bill aims to prevent residents from getting weed violations when neighbors report their natural gardens as overgrown weeds to the city's 311 system

• Council Member Warwick, who sponsored the bill, said the idea came from a City Paper article about people getting violations for gardens that don't look like typical flower gardens

• To register, residents would need to specify what native plants they're growing - it's not just letting grass grow wild

• Council Member Sharla raised concerns about property developers claiming tall weeds are ""natural landscapes"" to avoid maintenance requirements

• The ordinance still has rules - natural gardens can't block sidewalks, attract rodents, or create other problems

• Council Member Gross supported the bill and mentioned the ""No Mow May"" movement where people don't cut grass in May to help wildflowers grow

• The bill was held for two weeks so the Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections (PLI) can clarify some last-minute issues

• The ordinance would be due back to the Land Use and Economic Development Committee by May 14, 2025"
