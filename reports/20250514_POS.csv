   INVITED GUESTS:
   David Jones, Department of Public Safety Assistant Director, Community Affairs
   Kasey Macedo, Safe Passage Program Manager
   Danielle King, Safe Passage Director",NO_LEGISLATION,"good afternoon and welcome to pittsburgh city council's cablecast post agenda on the safe passage program for may 14- 2025. why don't we have folks come up, introduce yourselves and then i'll let you take it away? good afternoon, dave jones. assistant director of public safety for the city of pittsburgh. thank you so much, councilwoman, for this opportunity that everyone behind me has been pivotal in our safe passage program, so we will be displaying the great things that we have done. just a little background. safe passages started. there was an incident at Perry High School. miss Donna Buco from the Buell Foundation called mr Talley Thomas Thompson and asked him if he could come and just kind of put his eyes on some things. as a result, this safe passage initiative started. then, after the success of that, we were able to get a PCCD grant. this we're in seven high schools, in one middle school. just a couple quick data points and we'll be giving this to you and your colleagues is at the end. as a result of the safe passage program, there's been a 27 percent decrease in total discipline events, 25 percent decrease in major discipline events, 14 percent decrease in student involvement, 7% decrease in violent offense in 2024- and I've been saying this and we all been saying this- in the ages from 13 to 17, there were no homicides in that demographic, which is amazing, and that's partly to the work that our safe passage team has done in. unfortunately, in 2025 so far they've two teenage homicides, but that's been from gun play and not gun violence. There were people playing with guns, young people playing with guns, and it always ends in something that's not so good. And I would love to say, lastly, before I call up Mr Talley-Thompson, there's been 100% graduation rate with our safety ambassadors to date, So that deserves a hand clap. so i'll call up the. he certainly the brains and he's the quarterback of our safe passage project. mr tali thompson, how you doing. thank you for coming good, so just kind of jump right in. the safe passage program to to me is one of the most comprehensive collaborations that i've ever been a part of in my life. you know the way it got started with the buell foundation, making that initial investment in in community, where you know the model was pretty much that you had to get community members inside the schools to actually be a part of doing that work and then being able to get the students involved with actually doing the work as well- teaching them. the model was something that was extremely important. and then all of the collaborations with the different non-profits, the grassroots non-profits from infinite lifestyle solutions, one nation mentoring, arbor league and, obviously, you know, operation better block, and then also, what was a part of the secret sauce, as i, as i, as i like to say, you know, we started out in perry- and i have to give an amazing shout out- i'm glad she's here today- but what kind of took it to the next level is that when miss o'malley became principal at perry. so once we got that buy-in from the principal where we started the program at which was, you know, thanks, you know, to miss o'malley- it just kind of took it to another level. but there's always been this collaboration as well with pittsburgh public schools. i think this may be the one of the first times in my history of there actually being an mou between a non-profit, the city of pittsburgh government and actually pbs, and they were 100 committed when and had two amazing individuals, dr sacco and jason rivers, and you'll hear from them. to be honest, i just kind of wanted to throw that introduction in, but what you see behind me is the, the collaborative work, with our most comprehensive collaboration that the city has ever been a part of and that's what everybody that's actually in this room right now is a part of safe passage and making safe passes. you know, the program is that it is today. so, with that being said, i think it's less of me and more of of them, because they're the ones that actually do the heavy lifting. so, councilman, we'd like to call up. we have four students to talk about the pillars and we'll talk. we'll bring two up at a time, okay, is it okay if they come to the table? yeah, for sure, please. okay, let me stay here. okay, the first two, come on, let's go two, two, two ambassadors- no, no, let's go two at a time, right here on this side. please introduce yourselves, discuss the pillar and then also how this has. have you kind of escaped dealing with violence? okay, my name is anaya paulino and i'm from alderdice high school. safe passage is really a really strict but comfortable program for most of the students in our school. we come in, we conversate, we do activities to took a like to take our mind off of school and the stress that school has on us because it's getting towards the end of the year. most of our safe passage members are seniors so they come in, relax and just try to get positive views and leave out happy instead of irritated from school, basically. but safe passage really does help a lot of students outside of our program, like many students that aren't members. they come in if they have issues. they come to everyone that's in the the program for issues. for example, I had a conflict between friends that like we're gonna get into altercation, but I had stopped it because I had a mediation between them to try to get solution between just social media stuff, just negative social media words comments. it's been going around the school. we got to a fair solution where they just separated and now the group is totally fine. Hi, my name is Kimmy McKenday. I go to University Preparatory and I'm a safety ambassador. I'm a senior, I'm graduating June 12th. if y'all want to be there, The program to me is a safe space. I'm not a violent person. I know violent people and the Safe Passions ambassadors are the ones that try to kill the disease of violence. We do activities, We try to diffuse situations. We're really just trying to change the community, make everybody's life better. My pillar is changing community norms. I'm trying to change the way everybody acts. The norm shouldn't be violence period. It shouldn't be: if you're upset, you harm somebody else, or if you're hurt, you hurt someone else. It should be: everybody should come together, Everybody should, everyone should. everyone should be able to live in a safe space. thank you very much. give them a hand, please. next to please, please, introduce yourself a little bit about the program and what pillar you took we'll be talking about. oh, make sure you do the mics. yeah, just tap it. there you go. my name is the army Mobley, I'm a junior at Perry and the pillar that I'll be talking about is providing identities, because I want the young people in our school to be able to know like they'll be able to be heard and not feel like they're being brought down by other students in the building just because of the fact that they might not have the same things that just all the other students in the building. My name is Alicia and I'm a senior at Perry High School and I'm actually one of the first people to get into the Safe Passage program. I've been in a Safe Passage program since ninth grade- not even though I was a little bump, because I'm the reason why we have the safe passage program. like I'm not gonna make it seem like, you know, it's just our peaches and cream. you know everybody has their ups and downs. you know, like even even helped me. you know, like I was one of the people that was fighting. you know, not even gonna ask if in class and it, lucky like, helped me in in a way because I got Bodie. I had Miss Danny and let's give the biggest shout out to Miss O'Malley because it wouldn't even happen without Miss O'Malley. The people that I'm gonna be talking about is resources, because everybody needs somebody to talk to and we're young so we like to keep everything bubbled up. Like you know, we don't like to talk to people and it's better for people to talk to people their age, because not everybody our age wants to talk to people. Like, not everybody our age wants to like talk to adults. You know they'll feel more comfortable talking to somebody around their age or somebody that's been through something that they've been through. We also did like summer programs where, like we had Ms Markeia and we did like yoga. We did like little girls groups. You know she gave us like little gifts. you know, like self-care, self-respect. We also went on a trip to Atlanta and we went to like a conference meeting. You know we met different people from all around the cities and countries. You know we met people from New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Jersey. We met people from all over the city And it just brings out like a very good impact on students and even teachers themselves because they see that we can change. you know, People always think like, hmm, like I don't see no good in them, but everybody has good in them. everybody could change and make a way. and I have a shirt- no, not to like to my horn, but I have a shirt and it says: you don't get what you wish for, you get what you work for, basically meaning it's not gonna come to you. you got to put in the blood, sweat and tears to be successful. I'd like to mention that we are joined by Councilwoman Strasburger and councilwoman gross. so excellent, thank you. we'll now have councilwoman. our two coordinators will come up just to talk about, because they are the, the glue that helps hold our young, young people together. you guys can go. thank you so very much. yes, my name is Darryl go. I'm the safe court passes coordinator at Perry high school. it was a pleasure with tally. Thomas called me and said he wanted to make a change into a school that we kept from. we both graduated from Perry high school and we want to make a difference. when O'Malley came up and been impressive, what made a big change in our program. we were able to do more things and we work together as a team. like we have problems, we have people that will call us and I will call Molly and before I get to the school, we'll be able to handle situations before it's our building instead of like if it's a fight on the streets. by the time we get back to school Monday we already know about it, so we'll be able to attack the problem before it gets there. and the collaboration with everybody in this room has been great and it's a pleasure to work for a safe answer program and we're all making a difference and we get support that we need. y'all- y'all can see the pudding's in the right end. we got proof of the things that we have done. we took kids to atlanta, we went to seattle, we just came from the sandy program that was in philadelphia. so we are seeing our kids are going to see different things that they never had an opportunity to see before and, like i said i had a mentor that changed my life, and that's the thing i want to do to the kids that i work with: change their lives, thank you, hello everyone. my name is maya lowry. i am a safe passage coordinator at older dice high school, so being the glue every day. I'm a community member, come from where these kids come from, so I see myself within them. safe passage of is allowing these kids to have the resources that they may not have at home. allow them to get a paycheck every month, regardless of what it's for, if it's closed, if it's for food. we're actually helping these kids within school, but also outside of school. so the pillar that I connect with a lot is providing identities and changing community norms because we're changing the culture at older guys. the violence it's nothing like it was before safe passage. we have teachers coming to us every day and connecting with them just to stop the violence before it gets to escalating into the neighborhoods. we are partner with reach, so if there is something that is going on within the school and the violence is going to be out in the neighborhood, I can stop that. 10 o'clock in the morning, 8 o'clock in the morning before it, the valets is to the neighborhood and children are involved. also, like i said, it's just every day working with these children. it's it's something new, but it's exciting and it's rewarding because these kids look forward to coming to school. i mean, i've literally had students that have one point gpas who are now graduating with 3. 0 and they're attending school and they love to come to school and safe passage is a part of that. so i enjoy the work that i do. i love the work that i do and these kids need this program. i mean, i do, of course it's my job, but it's about the kids because they're our future. thank you, what's this real quick? what's the pillars you speak of? because council may not be clear when y'all talk about pillars. okay, connect the community norms, like working with the community, being inside the communities and being able to take things from the community, the school and bringing it. just a quick overview of the four pillars that you do teach the two, oh, identity, identity, Providing identity, connecting community, changing community norms. So the pillars that he's speaking of is our safety model that we, of course, teach the kids and the kids have to know being safety ambassadors. So providing identities and detecting and identifying high risk individuals within the community that we're working in, which is the school buildings that we're working in. So every day we're working out the safety models, we're making sure our safety best model so that, when going throughout the building, if they need to detect and interrupt the situation and defuse the situation, they're able to do that. if they need to provide identities to the friends that they know or you know high-risk individuals are, you know, into violence, they can help us connect with them so that the violence can be diffused. so that's our safety model and it's we're staying by it, thank you, and we're bringing everybody together. like some of our safety ambassadors. they get together. we have like events where we all get together and it's built to build community things. so when they see each other downtown, okay, we know them from being for the safe passage, so it stops a lot of the problems that's going on. so, like between schools- you mean in different schools, different schools, yes, yes, we have everybody come together. we do different events with everybody so everybody can know each other. so if they see each other, that's like, okay, that's one of my safety bachelor's sister or brother and it changes and it helps out and, like i said, they make sure we know everything that's going on so we can do things in the neighborhood that we need to do it. thank you very much. thank you. thank you, councilwoman. we now have a dr, nino sacco, and jason rivers also bring up reverend cornell jones, because he and jason rivers kind of do the same thing. am i good to start? am i good to go? okay, so one of the things that just go ahead and introduce yourself, i'm sorry. yes, good afternoon, nina sacco. assistant superintendent for pittsburgh public schools. so one of the things that we thought was really important at the beginning of this program was creating a memorandum of understanding with the city of pittsburgh that really allowed us to see the vision to fruition, to really realize the work that tali and david were hoping we would see happen. so we really focused on what our systems would be and how we were going to shift culture within the eight schools that had been identified. our mou very clearly identified our meeting times and spaces, which we met once a week, every friday, for about three hours. i would say initially what we found with those meetings that, as they progress, not only were we able to identify spaces where we needed to provide supports, but we were also able to identify ways in which culture change could come about, with systems changes within the buildings, and how we could collaborate with the city of pittsburgh in other areas. what became really just kind of glaringly important to us was that there was a level of trauma that also needed to be addressed within the schools which we were aware of, but how we would do that, utilizing really- and i'm going to use the term- brilliance of some of our students who live this every day right. so how were we able to work with our students to then make sure we as the adults were bringing our best selves forward and providing the best resources and recognizing how we could create change for for our kids? and that's where i'm. i'm going to turn it over to mr rivers, who's going to talk a little bit about that part. all right, good afternoon everyone. my name is jason rivers, project manager for pittsburgh public schools. i oversee the work that we do in the arena of violence prevention and intervention. safe passage, as you know, has been shared, the collaboration between entities around. you know how we think about safety and wellness inside of our school buildings, inside of our communities, and how this ecosystem communicates with each other, and so this collaboration has allowed the opportunity. when we talk about trauma, complex trauma that families are dealing with, students are dealing with at times, staff members the fatigue that they're dealing with, and even as we talk about post-pandemic, you know there's a lot of things that communities are still trying to stabilize on and this collaboration allows, you know, research speaks to. you know, where there's three caring adults around a young person, how the trajectory, the life trajectory, is significantly changed. so when we think about hope- and hope is the word that comes to mind for me- when we talk about this collaboration and investment, investment can come by way of, you know, economic resources, and i think the greatest capital that this collaboration has is relationships, being able to get in front of concerns that young people have or that parents have. even staff people have to know that we're interrupting snitch culture where it's safe to communicate when i i'm having an issue with somebody else and i don't know what to do about that, and, and you know so, the the program's built on those sort of pillars. we do monday safety calls where you know if there's anything that occurred over the weekend. you know we can get in front of those things for the impact of school, because we know, sometimes things from community carry into school and then vice versa, things can carry from community back- i mean, excuse me- from school back to community. so this, this collaboration, has been invaluable and i think about the increased hope and excitement that has been built in mitigating, you know, violence, instability. so we we know we have a work to do, but to hear the stories of young people, the excitement that they have from the collaboration and program and the inner communication between schools and principal, where critical information is being shared, where there wasn't systems in place for those sort of things to happen and in the past. so you know, salute to all the leaders that have made it occur and, and most importantly, to the young people who do a phenomenal job and showcasing their brilliance and giftedness. the last thing i'll just say is: you know, i think another thing that the program and young people exhibit is we talk a lot about, like post-traumatic stress, right, and many of our community members of experience Issues around complex trauma. we tend not to talk about post traumatic growth and there's so much growth around resiliency and hope, and you heard some of those stories exhibited today, And so I'm excited to have a small part of the, the work has been done and as it's a delight to hear the young people talk about the change in impact that has had on their lives. what's important as far as our collaboration, councilwoman, is that mr Rivers is to PPS with Reverend Cornell Jones is to the city of Pittsburgh. so thank you, sir. greetings every everyone. hello. it's been exciting to see- I was there at the meeting that was at Perry High School and Dinah Bucco called people there to be able to talk about some of those situations and to see a new principle, a new vision and these things come together has been. it's been empowering and exciting at the same time. i remember when, when the conversation was with tali to be able to find those key individuals that could actually come into the schools that have the relationships, and now that to see that those key individuals are there and the work is being there. and- And I was blessed to be able to see some of the students in Seattle when we were at a violence prevention conference and these young Safe Passages students were like on the forefront of leading conversations about what they're doing And up to the point where other people and other organizations were like yo, we wanna learn more. That made me very proud to be able to experience that and to be able to say that they're part of Pittsburgh. You know what I mean. So, like, our collaborations are everything, even to the point where if something is about to happen, if something happened in the school, they'll they'll send out a notification to let me know and let certain people know- jason, dr sacco, director jones and and school police, to be able to let them know what's going on. and this is this is this is a 24 hours thing, so we're able to jump on things, to be able to strategize, so, as tali was talking about, so when the morning hits, we already got a strategy together and then, once again, we then tie into some of our city social workers, we then tie into the center for victims, we tire into what i like to call the village as much as possible to be able to pull these resources together. i've, as tali said, i've never seen a collaboration like this. you know what i mean. i've never seen it. and it's funny because when we were outside in the hallway, you would think that we all worked for the same organization, but because that's how much we're used to working together, we were used to, you know, in a drop of a dime. you know we talk every monday morning. you know we deal with each other on a regular basis, what? and that's the social worker, that's all of us working together to find out what it is to be able to tap into the resource that we need for the young people, for the young geniuses. and then we end up getting, you know, the, the young people who are part of safe passages program. we respect the genius that's in them. so if they're saying that we need to add resources and, for example, like, we found out that we needed to add some support to carrick because of the, the, the stress that they were having losing multiple students, so, like those are from conversations and guess what, we pulled the team together to be able to work up there and help the teachers up there. so these are: we're utilizing the geniuses that are in these young people and then the safe passage staff and, just you know, utilizing that, still working together with the reach program, utilizing the, the law enforcement piece, then utilizing the strategies that we have and pulling it all together. and it's been amazing, thank you. thank you so much. i can't go any further and we just have a couple more councilmen. miss molly is the principal from perry. we need her just to come. she's been our one of our hugest, biggest cheerleaders in this effort and we'd be remiss without having her, and she's been in this the longest with us. so i think, as i'm listening, i don't want to repeat, but i think where i'm going to kind of focus is resources, and then i'm going to talk about mediation, and so for me, the, the biggest benefit is the resources that our school is connected to outside in the community, and so things happen in school. it's part of school, it's part of daily life. but to be able to connect to outside entities and stop anything further from happening in the neighborhood is invaluable. Since I've been principal of Perry, which is this is my third year- last year we had one incident that started in school that carried over, and this year I think we just had one, And prior to me and this program being in Perry, I don't think that was the case- And so connecting and me having access to- well, I have access to Jason, sorry, but to mr Thompson, to mr Jones- it's just invaluable and it links us together. when we think, when I think of schools, I think school should be the hub of the community. that's just my personal opinion, and so this program has created that. and then the linkage between us and outside the city is just invaluable, and I would keep saying that, but it truly is. the next I want to highlight: changing the norms of your school. and so what does it look like when you change norms? if you're an educator, you know that in behavior management- behavior management system- the highest level is when students can redirect other students and they can receive that redirection. and so we're not a hundred percent there, but we're. we're definitely moving forward. students have a bigger impact on other students, and so when you see a student stepping up and saying, hey, come on, that you know that late bells gonna ring, let's go, let's get moving. you know miss O'Malley, you want to hear her mouth, you know she wants us in class on time- that makes a more powerful impact than me saying, hey, come on, let's go to class. what Diami and Alicia didn't talk to you about- and I wish they would have, because they are probably the best mediators I've seen. I actually think they're better than some adults. I could pull them in in the hallway. they could absolutely know nothing about the situation that's happening and they could mediate the students so that it could stop anything from transpiring. and when you see that, you know that you're headed in the right direction. you know we say we don't expect perfection, I don't expect perfection out of anyone, but we strive for it, and so that's what I want see in our students and in our community what i think is important. and thank you, miss molly. i just want to reiterate that we've broken down the silos between this, the city and pittsburgh public schools. i mean we can walk in to any school at any time and feel welcome and be able to navigate. additionally, they can come to any of our places and everything is fine. i think the communication has been paramount. we also use new era 412 that the council has funded. that is also the communication system we use between our safe passage coordinators and our reach team. so when things happen in the school- whether it's potential violence or the balance has already occurred- they automatically connect with our reach workers so we can get things together, pulling Reverend Cornell Jones and if the police is necessary, that happens as well. so we've broken down the styles. this has been the amazing collaboration. I just want to reiterate that before we bring up dr Norm Conti. so the last thing that I wanted to add is: you know Jason Rivers and myself will end up going to we'll make a home visit, like a lot of times you'll hear us talking about custom notifications for so, from situations where we think that that young person might do something to get themselves and more trouble, gets himself or someone else in some type of danger, we'll go and visit a house, we'll go and talk to the family and that type of stuff and sit down and do an intervention right there. that's the of collaboration that we didn't have before and a lot of that connection came from safe passage program. so with that the families usually thank us because that connection is there to be able to help bring peace. so when, when, when they're talking about this collaboration notification, it's actually a system that was a part of the new era system that anytime that a risk level assessment is submitted that has a three or four, everybody that's actually here gets an automatic notification in their email right, saying a risk of a three or four has been submitted into the system. an automatic email starts notifying everybody that's at this table, from public safety to even the law enforcement at pittsburgh public schools and then the collaboration kind of starts happening right away where folks are responding off of a risk level assessment. that didn't happen until this collaboration of between the city and pbs and non-profits Will we be able to actually upgrade that system, to add that notification part to it. So I just wanted to be clear, because you know there's some language, but I want to be clear- that it's an alert system that if a three or four enters the system, an automatic email is hitting all of our emails. I'd like to add also the collaboration that exists, which you know started out as being really intentional with the development of the MOU, But it has created relationships where when we do get a threat assessment, you know an assessment from ARIC 412, when Mr Rivers and Reverend Cornell Jones go out, the level of violence that is prevented at times is- I mean, you're talking about life and death situations sometimes. So I don't think that that should be lost in this space. i don't. i don't want us to not call that out, because we have multiple examples of situations where both of these gentlemen have really worked at preventing something from happening that could have been catastrophic. so there's a part, and that exists here, that i just think needs to be called out on that. thank you, dr conti is with us from duquesne and councilman. we also have at the end. we have some handouts and we can send stuff to you electronically. that will talk about our data and I know that part is super important and so we have that covered. but he would also can also speak to that collaboration as well. first, thank you all so much for having me here today. like my good friend Cornell said, it was really cool out in the lobby. it was one organization and one family made up of so many different people, and to be here with so many of my good friends and the people I've gotten to work with is wonderful. I'm a professor at Duquesne University. I'm a co-founder of the Elsinore Bennu think tank for restorative justice. I had the honor and the privilege to work with this organization At Duquesne University. we're doing what we can to support this work. through our school of education, We're offering opportunities for our advanced students to work on analysis and evaluation and refinement and improvement of the program, giving what they have to offer and giving them the opportunity to learn in real time and real practice. with this situation. On top of that, our office of community engagement is working to look to help score funding for this program And personally myself, I'm working on a class called Performing History, Autobiography and Progress. We've got some really great actors and writers and we work with kids in the Safe Passages program and we're working sort of on the identity transformation piece, where we give these kids a chance to work with people they've seen in actual movies they like and who are listening to them and are getting them to tell stories, their stories, and getting them to see themselves as writers and artists- not that they have to be that professionally, but that's a part of their identity. and when you open up, whether it's kids, whether it's, in my experience, whether it's guys in jails, whether it's police officers, when you get people thinking in ways that they don't usually, when you use the arts and the humanities, you get some results that you probably wouldn't expect. so we've been doing that with students in the past couple years at a number of the schools and we're also working with some accidentally. we're working with some of your safety ambassadors through 412 boxing. we're running the same program, performing history on ira in progress with them and we're putting together a book that's hopefully going to include a number of all the kids, and it's something like writing fighters or fighting writers, right, because all these- all these boxers first- are fighting right, and all the safety ambassadors. they're fighting for their community, right, and they have such amazing stories to tell and i think i don't know them that well, but i know some of these kids and the kids that are probably the best at this negotiation and this about this intervention. they're probably great storytellers. so, again, thank you so much. personally, i'm thrilled- i know duquesne- with our commitment. the university is thrilled and it's just wonderful to be a part of this councilman. that our presentation. we appreciate your. yes, I was going to do that again as well. yes, everyone that is involved, please, with safe passage. I was going to get to our data has been prepared by Tori and Casey and we have our other directors back to. can you guys please stand, because Tally's been nudging me for the past 45 minutes. this is just the staff that does the heavy lift and you know I, you know I have a pleasure of working with director Jones, but these are the folks that are in the school really, you know doing a lot of that hard work and go ahead. miss King is the director of the safe passage program. i'm just the creator of it, dr danny. hello everyone, i'm danielle king. i'm the director of safe passage. it's been an honor to do this work. tally caught me back in. well, i actually met tally. i'm a student at duquesne as well and i met him some time ago at the think tank when i was pregnant and he called me some time ago to do this work and I love it. I'm actually, you know, like I said, a student at Duquesne. so I'm doing this work, real time learning how to improve. you know, learning, I don't know, just different ways to support my community, empower them, parent engagement- that's what my dissertation is on. so just trying to think of more ways to get families involved and parents involved. when we talk about, you know, being surrounding kids, that is academic work. a child is in the middle and surrounding that child we have the family, the school, in the community and we all have to intertwine for the best of the child. so that's the work that we're doing and this is all proven. God willing, should be dr king in august. yes, i don't want anyone in the back mad at me. is anyone else? our kids, our coordinator that works with, like several of the young ladies schools. you want to come speak real quick because, like i said, i'm i'm just blessed to work with director jones, but these are the folks that are really in the trenches, you know, and it's important to recognize them aired to come and speak today. but my name is marquia lowry and i am the female and coordinator and i work across four schools: arlington university prep, westinghouse and older dice- and it has been a pleasure working with our female ambassadors. that's been my focus since i've been on board with obb and we talk about the impact that this program makes, but each individual ambassador has made an impact on me personally. i know someone mentioned- i think it was one of our perry ambassadors mentioned- that they're viewed as lost causes and they're really not. there's so much potential, so much talent that i get to bear witness to every single day working in these schools and they are making drastic change and I give them the space to be them and sometimes that's all they need to fill the hope, to fill the love, to fill the encouragement to work the model and to be amazing individuals, because they all truly are. yeah, Rick and Casey, but I don't know. we got Rick, we got one in one. more student ambassador, right, two more. come on, come on, let's do this quickly. councilman, thank you so much for your indulgence. i'm getting hijacked by one of my. i apologize. well, i'll go. rick butler, i'm a safe passage coordinator at older ice high school. i think the biggest thing for me is just like being able to build the relationships with kids and then actually see it come to come to fruition, for them to do different things like we got. pat been with us probably since the beginning of the program, probably- i don't want to make his head big, but one of my favorites because i just seen the transformation in him and his behaviors and the way he's disciplined, you know, with him getting involved in other things outside of school. and we just had a kid who's graduating this year who was walking around with like a one, three, one, four last report period, like a three, three, two or three, three, something like that. you know i'm saying his focus is like crazy right now. so i mean just able to see that, see things like that and see them actually being involved in things like real big for me. my name- my name is patrick germain. i'm from alderdice. one big thing about the group for me is like providing identities because, like i was able to do that like after like joining boxing outside of school, and like it just opens up so much opportunities for your future when you're boxing and stuff and this group right here. so, like, for me, i'm ranked number seven in the country now and i'm trying to get that, that number one. i ain't gonna lie, we got nationals coming up. So you know, yeah, you know what I'm saying. yeah, Young man, Hello, My name is Jaheim Jeffries. I'm coming from Older Dice High School And for me, a big thing about the program is changing community norms. seeing like Rick as a black man coming to the school every day- and you know, going to work is a big thing because there's not a lot of African-American men in the school present- But also, I would say preventing identities as well, because every like, like the kids from you prep said being a lost cause. i guess there's no such thing as a lost cause in the school, because if you're going, if you're waking up each morning, showing up for school, you can't be a loss, because that's the first thing. and i feel like providing identities is just real big on that, because there's something for everyone. i feel like, even if, like for safe passage, a lot of people out here safe passage and they hear the four pillars and like, oh, we don't want to do that, like that's long, you know, it's still a safe space for people to come together to stop the disease of violence. thank you, all right. thank you everyone, any questions? because we have some, some handouts we'll give. we can also send to you electronically any question. any questions. yeah, go ahead members. yeah, all right. thanks, thanks, council member Barbara Warwick for hosting this post-agenda hearing, and thank you everyone who spoke. I really apologize that I missed the first 15 minutes as I was getting out of another meeting, So I missed some of the introductory remarks and maybe some of the testimonials. but this is, you know, this kind of collaboration and this on this exact issue area is exactly what we need and it's obviously borne out. We've already seen. I'll look at the data, but the anecdotal data, I think qualitative data also important to see that it is. it is changing lives on daily basis. so great, great work everyone. i i hear about different programs and i don't always understand how they interact, so i'm just going to ask the question. this is its own program. you're all operating as if you're under one roof, one entity, and that's exactly, i think, what we need. then i also hear speaking of Perry, and you know I heard Diana Bucco's name. I also know that a plus schools has their program on truancy and attendance and sort of figuring out strategies for in each high school, working with teachers and working with the principal to try to wrap the community's arms around the schools. I'm wondering how this program interacts with that program, if at all, or if they're just kind of, if they're integrated at all, they're separate, if they're just existing side side. we've worked with a plus schools, we've met with we, so we work with a plus schools. they were a part of language, i mean meetings when we were, you know, discussing language and implementation. so a plus school was actually at the table as i was working with the buell foundation on the implementation plan. so and and then also, you know, depending on which you know school in particular, miss o'malley could probably speak to the way that she creates collaboration between all the programs that are within her school, and that was something that we was intentional about. is that we, we didn't want to for safe passage to come into existence, right, and then say that you no longer need the other programs, that that that are within your building. so it. so safe passage in itself is a model that collaborates with other programs and non-profits that are already in the school and we just kind of use our model to fit them into the work that they already do. so when we started, you know, safe passage if there was a school, let's say, one nation mentoring was up at beshear, right, the principal. but she says, ty, we would like for that individual or their team to be our safe, our safe patches coordinators, right. so we just kind of taught them the pillars to teach the students that that they're working with, and then add safety ambassadors on. so now you end up having getting more. you already had one nation mentoring. now there's a collaboration between us and safe passage and one nation mentor, now you get more. the goal was that this collaborative language was was going to- because actually that's what it takes to be able to change the culture inside these schools- is these collaborative relationships. it can't be one thing in and another thing out, like that's called the hamster in a wheel, where you're replacing one thing with another. it has to be this and that. thank you. what i would also like to add to that is: no, i just wanted to add one thing with the breshear example, tali also brought on someone from casa san jose to work with some of our students at breshear. so there is that, you know, through all of the collaboration that we're doing on our end, when one of us recognizes something, as he did, like hey, this, we need to bring someone on from this organization at breshear because they have these relationships with students, and then we're, you know, we're able to do that based on all the various collaborations and different programmings. sorry, director, no problem. additionally, our safe patches coordinators know the other programs that are in the school and organically, i mean, they certainly get our assistance, but they they talk because they're also from the community as well. that's great. that's great to hear there was, i, I think, someone who wanted to speak. Do you want to come up to the microphone? Thank you All. good, you can just speak With the A-plus community. we also, Baldy and I, at the beginning of every school year we collaborate with them by going to the homes within the north side and delivering book bags to the incoming freshmen. So we've been doing that collaborative for what? the past two, three years. So they're definitely somebody we work with. Yeah, thank you, And that's just. you know, the APLS example is one example, but I heard other examples: Casa, San Jose and others that are in there too. so great to hear that each school is sort of determining how best to coordinate. We even had Arbery actually pays for half of our safety ambassadors at Perry right And that was through the support of Diane, where, as we continue to get more and more support, other organizations wanted to actually take on a responsibility of funding some of the safety ambassadors. So when I say it, I'm being sincere when I say this is one of the most comprehensive collaborations that I've ever been a part of in my history of doing this work within the city of Pittsburgh. Can I add, Ty, too, that because of the work and because of the collaboration that we've been doing, there's an organization called Cities United that we work with. in fact, some of the students that are here- a lot of us- have actually gone the conferences where all the violence intervention teams from across the country come like they're gonna, because they heard about the collaboration in july. they're talking about coming here and looking at what we do because they're hearing about the collaboration as like a collaboration like no other, so that's exciting news, then. that's something that i think we should be excited about, because a lot of they're hearing about how the city in the county, how safe passages, the reach program, all of us from the city and all that type of stuff are working together, is strategically when in unity, because a lot of times, a lot of cities don't do that, and that's something that we've seen. when we go into these conferences, they will. there's issues because over money, a lot of times and things such as that, as i said before, we were outside as one. you know what i mean- and that's something that people are hearing about across the country, and cities united is something that, if you look it up, you'll see that this is a national program that's doing amazing work, and for them to look at us as being like one of the models so that they can bring other cities to see, i think is important for us for you guys to know about. yeah, absolutely Okay, thank you. One final question, and that is this: really integrated collaboration's been like the word of the day. it's like so integrated, and I am really impressed by that and I'm wondering if maybe to our PPS representatives or our others, if you think there's room for this to occur in other realms. so this is the trauma, interruption or intervention, restorative justice realm, when it comes to, say, out of school time, city and PPS right and how we integrate more around that. Do you think there's? this is a leading question, but do you think there's room for that? Is there capacity? is there room, is there an opportunity or an appetite for that? those kinds of conversations in other realms Go ahead. I think there's always room for that. I think using the model or how we approach this work, because really, when we reflect upon how we got to this space and how these relationships sort of built organically, it really came out of that beginning where we sat down and said, okay, what's important to PPS, What's important to the city of Pittsburgh, to OBB, How do we put that in a document that's gonna hold all of us accountable? Then the beauty: it became more than just accountability. the beauty in that was all of the people sitting around the table really saw the potential in this, wanted to make a difference, wanted to see culture change and were just so invested and committed in the work itself And that extended beyond just our small group, you know, and Jason too, he's back there- and Danielle- But that we modeled that for the schools. So this was our expectation When we we would meet with schools regularly, go in and we'd have meetings with the principal and, you know, the coordinators and the kids and whomever in the schools. but at the same time we were also modeling for them our relationship and how closely we worked with one another. and so i think there is room. i think that the intentionality and the authenticity really needs to be their invulnerability. people need to be okay with being vulnerable in the spaces. i know somebody also think: what is important if you talk about our stop the violence grantees. so what we've done intentionally is breaking down the silos, giving them some, some money so they're all working together, you know, throughout the zones, cross zones, throughout. so, yes, that is, there's always room for collaborative efforts across the board. that's one of the things that we've been trying to push: breaking down the silos, increasing the communication and working together in a deep, meaningful manner. thank you, council members. those are all my question. thank you all. thanks, councilwoman. thank you, councilwoman. so i am so impressed. i'm so really deeply moved and impressed by all of the work that you all have put in. thank you so much, and i have given dr jones some hassle over the years. that's kind of excuse, that's kind of our job on this side of the table, right. so i'm thinking back. it was three or four years ago when, you know, i was like where is the data? and now we've got it in our hands, right, where are? and i think you'll remember this one keenly- there was a room full of just men and i said: where are the female mentors? they're with us today and i see them and i'm so glad to see the female students and the female mentors and i really appreciate that. and so it takes time to put these kinds of programs together, but also it really takes. I heard the word genius and said about the students, the genius leaders here, and I think I don't know but I wonder if, like that was your turning point, like it seems like you, really you have student leadership here and and I see that things have not just pulled together but blossomed and grown and beyond blossom like grown trees, and I don't even know all the metaphors I'm reaching for you, I'm not that good at that, but that this is a really robust program that is making a really, really substantial difference, clearly, and so really, I can see that in your stories. I can. I can hear that your stories, I can see that the people I see in the room, and I can see it on the numbers as well. so thank you for having the numbers. I I also want to admit that before I walked in here, I did not understand how big this had gotten. I think a few years ago we were talking about getting kids safely on their buses home. Okay, good, Okay, am I really that kind of out of sync with what's happening? That is not what we're talking about here. Like you all are creating. I don't even know what to say. we've talked about collaboration, we've talked about community, but we're talking really about like a new- almost like it feels like a new- Pittsburgh. It feels really big. So I really appreciate that right, The kinds of problems that we would hear about at this table, that they seemed too big, But now we've got- it sounds like you've got- solutions that have met their moment. right, You've created really, really big solutions for what were really really big problems. So thank you, Because it takes a little bit of a leap of effort and it takes your time and your energy and your love and your effort to keep it going and to do all that, And I can really feel that everybody in the room did that. So I really, really appreciate that. So I mean again to recap, I took several pages of notes, right, I heard everything from performing history and storytelling to really working on the trauma of not just students but also teachers and staff and really kind of addressing all of the healing to that. everybody had more right: You have to take care of yourself first, so you have more to give. right, that literally the kind of core group was spending every Friday together, because it takes a lot of- there's like a thousand or more things to do when you're kind of like turning a big ship and you're turning and you're changing those cultures and you're changing the way people have been doing things for decades, or or and creating something new that you you know you don't know what it is that you need to create, but you know you need to create something- but also connecting the kids in our schools to resources, even jobs and outside programs, again coordinating with the other kind of charitable efforts that have been going on for a long time but didn't have really hadn't manifested the kind of change that they had hoped to be right, and I know the leaders of a post schools, I know the leaders of the real foundation and I know what they have been trying to do and have done in other realms. but to see it happen so broadly and in such a big way and in like eight of our schools is really amazing. so I don't want to take up much more time because I think the value here today was really hearing the stories. I'm getting it in the public record again, just if you didn't know. this is like an official council meeting, so this is in the record forever. right it is. you'll be able to pull it up on legislative database and this is kept in our vault of video kind of minutes and because it feels historic too. so i appreciate that. so i'm not going to take any more time, madam chair, i appreciate it, thank you. thank you, councilman, for your words. thank you very much, yeah, thank you. So, yeah, this is all incredibly impressive. And one thing I did have a well, so one thing I was- I don't know if you feel comfortable for our ambassadors in the room- if you wanted to share, and again, only if you feel comfortable, but of an example, because I'm interested in maybe an example of how So you're working in the schools, sort of managing incidences, mediating, but do you have any examples of how you have brought that you know home into your community, sort of outside of school time, whether that's in the summer or on the weekend or whatever? like these skills have they ever helped you? I don't know if you have any, if any of you wanted to share. Since going to Otterdijk, a lot of us come from the same communities, like Hazelwood's a big one. A lot of the Hazelwoods. A lot of students from older guys go to Hazelwood. I mean come from Hazelwood and I'll say a lot of things that happens in school will travel outside of school. but I'll say this as a safety ambassador: if they see me, or if they see me and they know if I say something like, oh, come on, everybody, just chill out, it's not cool, that will stick into someone's head because even if I just say it to one person, if he goes and says it to one more person, it spreads. like that it can stop the disease of violence, just like that. Yeah, anyone else, Yeah, go ahead. Can you repeat the question one more time. Well, just if you can think of an example where sort of what you've learned in this program at school, participating in this, has helped you out sort of in the world in your own life, whether on the weekends, at night, in the summer, whatever, just in your own community, When I'm outside on a normal day and I just see people just on some stuff, Like I, just like you know I be trying to help them out. you feel what I'm saying? Like I don't know, like now, like like when people doing bad stuff, or like you know what I'm saying. like cussing and stuff it just like it's like it just gross me out. you know what I'm saying. I gotta help them out. you feel what I'm saying. Get them on track. you feel me? Yeah, that's about it. Great, I feel like being a part of this and since I get paid to do it, it's my job to like interrupt things before they escalate to something bigger, because I go to you prep, so anything that happens in school will be an even bigger thing out of school. everything has to be a bra like. if you don't interrupt it, everybody's going to be in the situation. so should I say a story? are you an example. it's a couple examples. we have to get a little bit there. there were two girls, younger girls, because i don't know why, but like all the younger girls are starting to be like the disease they're, they're the infectors, like everything that happens is within them. i feel like we've, like the older kids from, i think, the seniors that graduated last year from safe passage. safe passage has impacted them so much that the kids that are coming out they don't do like the stuff they used to do. there's not as much violence with them. nobody wants to go out school and fight because we're all getting older, we all have learned like it's not doing anything for us. so these girls, they were probably fighting about a boy or something. it wasn't, it wasn't anything that couldn't be solved. so I think I seen them in the hall one day and they're arguing. but it's like their friend group is arguing and the other girl's friend group is arguing and I'm like it's getting to the point. it's about to be a big thing. everybody's running up there to see they're about the fight and I'm just like I pulled the girl to the side and I'm like what are you gonna get out of this? like you're fighting her because of this boy and the boy, he's not gonna come and like, pick one of y'all, it's not gonna be a, I'll get you, I'll get you. y'all are just gonna be fighting. neither one of y'all is gonna have the boy after that or y'all still gonna have to share. so I'm like like what do you want to fight her for? she disrespected me, she said this, she said that, but it's about the boy. you're arguing about the boy. so I'm just like, like what if you get beat up? like you're just gonna fight her, somebody's gonna win, somebody's gonna lose, but it's not gonna solve the problem. you're still gonna argue and then it's going to get to the friends, it's going to affect everybody. they're going to be fighting. it'll be just a forever thing, ongoing, long going, and it would just never be peace. so I think that's the end of my story, like they didn't end fighting, they didn't know. and i think what's important to to what she's speaking to is that the pillars that we teach the ambassadors, the first one is interrupting the transmission of disease, of violence, and that's an example of when she kept saying that if she didn't interrupt that, then once it happened, she was saying how things become a brawl right and that's how that that disease kind of kind of you know, spreads. and also what's being clear is that she's just they're paid on a monthly basis. they're on obb's payroll each. all these safety ambassadors- we have 94 safety ambassadors on operations, better box payroll through this safe passage program where they're receiving 200 a month. and it's me that's important to make sure i'm clear about that is that the way that you know it worked. the grant worked. we thought we was going to be able to stipend them but because it came from the state, we had to actually put them on payroll. so we had 94 students currently, right now, as paid safety ambassadors on payroll. i also have another story, just like cammy's, but it was mostly outside of school. i, i would say i have a lot of friends and all the guys, i'm nice to everyone. i'm just someone everyone comes to and talks to if they have an issue. i will say there's a lot of issues when it comes with relationships. everyone, everyone is in everyone's business. when it comes to relationship, if you like someone, it's going to get around the school, it's going to get outside the school. it's like there's no stopping it. and there was this day where two of my friends it was. this happened way before I was in the program, way before. well, it was the beginning of the school. they had an issue where one liked the boy and when I was talking to a boy outside of school, she I wouldn't say snitched, but she told that boy that she liked her and it upset her. and during school, before it happened outside of school, during school, they were arguing and I'm I was just. I think I was sleeping at this point, but I woke up and I'm just like: why are we arguing? what are we arguing about? and they reminded me about something I talked to them about before. they brought it up to the teacher and other students are getting into it, just making the situation bigger. and I'm just like, guys, we've been through this, it's not that big of a deal. then, outside of school, I saw them arguing. while we were hanging out, they went to the side and started arguing. I'm just like, why are we arguing about this? we're outside, it's a nice day and we're all trying to be if, be all friends, be all cordial, but you know, children are really really, really hard to. I don't know they're, I will say freshmen and sophomores, like recent freshmen, are really hard to just like convince to stop arguing about the littlest things, especially when it comes to relationships, because they don't understand the big picture and they just want to fight, they just want to get over it. but what they don't know is just a continuous circle. it's a never-ending circle. you're just gonna keep arguing and fighting until you come to the realization that you're fighting over the most tiniest thing. so we kind of came to that solution which I explained when I first introduced myself, kind of came to the solution where they just separated it kind of diverse- the friend group a little bit. it's a little rocky now, but we're cool. the situation is calm. there's no ice, there's no nothing. everyone's just calm into themselves now. so I feel like the program really helps me help my friends and even outside of school people who are I'm not friends with, and even if I personally don't like them, I still would help them at the end of day with problems they have. so they realize that they don't have to fight and argue about it. they can just get over it and let it be what it is. thank you, thank you. so, yeah, one question: what is it? is there? is there an element of the program or maybe looking forward with sort of like a mental health component, sort of availability of therapy and or yeah, okay, i'm sorry. what we've done in the past is that we brought other organizations that specialize in that in to have sit downs with our ambassadors and it becomes a lot easier. one time in particular after the event with the, the airbnb on the north side right, that was a real traumatic event. so we had a relationship with, with centers for victim right, and they kind of came in with our ambassador, with our coordinators, and had had sessions, you know, had sessions. so what we end up doing is organizations that specialize in those different things. we kind of bring them in, you know, when we have those weekly meetings with our ambassadors, so that they can kind of have those conversations to where typically, if you don't bring them in through the pathway that they're always familiar with and sometimes they just kind of reject it may exist and it's there, but the kids may not kind of engage in it. so that's one thing we've been focusing on when it comes to trauma is bringing some of those trauma organizations in along with us to sit down with the kids on a weekly, on weekly basis when we have those opportunities too. additionally, we also have when there are severe acts of violence. in our schools we have social workers that also come in to work with the students. but that's also relational in that some of the social workers don't know our students, but if one of our members from safe passage or reaches there, that kind of that helps that introduction go a lot easier. so they'll sit down and speak with a social worker that they may not otherwise if these vehicles weren't in our schools. we also have. they spoke about the new era 412 system. it's not just our data management and system of accountability, but we also utilize it for external resources and referrals. so like we're connected with the 2-1-1 app and we can send these resources directly to the students phones. so there's so many reasons. one resources on there, so you can go on there, resolve UPMC, mercy, behavioral, so we can connect with all of those through the application as well. great, thank you, yeah, so I mean I just overall. you know we, you know we talk a lot about violence and crime in the city and and you know lots of it. you know there's gonna be a post agenda, I think, tomorrow night about you know or sorry, not a post agenda, a public hearing about violence. but I think that one thing that a lot of folks, certainly myself, kind of don't appreciate is that when we are talking about violence, and specifically gun violence that you know well, i mean, i guess i could ask a question: who here of folks in this room have had a family member or very close friend have lost a family member or close friend to gun violence, just like show of hands right, and how many people ha know more than one person who has been lost to gun violence, like in their immediate right? and that's something. so i you know, you know, since I've been in this role and I have- I represent Hazelwood, so I have some good friends and that is always something that you know just hanging out, you know, just going, you know just, and, and we have these conversations and friends say to me like, oh, my son, what you know was, you know people who have lost their children, people who whose children have been shot. maybe they didn't, but you know, and it's all pervades, it's like everyone, and that is so not the reality. for, for example, in my world right, and I think that we fail to recognize that when we are here in Pittsburgh talking about crime and violence, and you know, and I am so glad that, and for me, I find Pittsburgh to be very safe In my world. right, Pittsburgh is very safe. right in the neighborhood I live in, my kids walked, whatever, like you know. and so, and this is where the real danger is and that is what you are all working toward solving and you're getting it done, right, When we look at these numbers, when we look at, you know, a 27% drop in discipline events, a 14% drop of students involved in those events, you know a 7, you know an almost 8% drop in violence in just one year. right, that is actually solving and it doesn't happen all at once, right, and so, you know, we all talk. you know it's easy to sort of sit in your armchair and watch Stephen talk about what should happen, what could happen, you know. but you know, teachers are overwhelmed, parents are overwhelmed, kids are overwhelmed, I mean even even in, in any, in any, even myself, right, I'm sure my kids' teachers are overwhelmed and I, you know, and I'm overwhelmed. but when you add this reality of gun violence and maybe housing insecurity and maybe issues of mental health in the community, and you add all that together, this reimagining of public safety, and that is the thing. right? That is what we have been seeing here in Pittsburgh over the past two, three years. right Is this commitment to reimagining how we do public safety, and that is getting to the root cause. right, that is working together in a co-response way, like you said, breaking down the silos, because the police can't fix this alone, the schools can't fix this alone, the city can't fix this alone, the community groups can't fix this alone, the football coaches can't fix this alone. right, it takes everybody together, and i'm I'm just really so impressed, And I love even that you've got the technology too right with the apps. I mean, this is such an impressive effort And I'm really glad to hear that it's been recognized nationally. you know, I don't really have any questions. I just want to congratulate you all on the incredible work And thank you because you are doing the work to make pittsburgh a safer city. i just want to say to you: thank you so much, councilman, for hosting us. you have no idea i could have filled this room up with people that wanted to come and speak, but we tried to narrow down that we wouldn't overwhelm. but we appreciate you and the councilman for even just entertaining us today and hosting us. we appreciate that, thank you, thanks. oh, i guess with that i don't have my, my little script. okay, so, having exhausted the business of this post agenda, the meeting is adjourned. thank you.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

**Section of meeting transcript:**
good afternoon and welcome to pittsburgh city council's cablecast post agenda on the safe passage program for may 14- 2025. why don't we have folks come up, introduce yourselves and then i'll let you take it away? good afternoon, dave jones. assistant director of public safety for the city of pittsburgh. thank you so much, councilwoman, for this opportunity that everyone behind me has been pivotal in our safe passage program, so we will be displaying the great things that we have done. just a little background. safe passages started. there was an incident at Perry High School. miss Donna Buco from the Buell Foundation called mr Talley Thomas Thompson and asked him if he could come and just kind of put his eyes on some things. as a result, this safe passage initiative started. then, after the success of that, we were able to get a PCCD grant. this we're in seven high schools, in one middle school. just a couple quick data points and we'll be giving this to you and your colleagues is at the end. as a result of the safe passage program, there's been a 27 percent decrease in total discipline events, 25 percent decrease in major discipline events, 14 percent decrease in student involvement, 7% decrease in violent offense in 2024- and I've been saying this and we all been saying this- in the ages from 13 to 17, there were no homicides in that demographic, which is amazing, and that's partly to the work that our safe passage team has done in. unfortunately, in 2025 so far they've two teenage homicides, but that's been from gun play and not gun violence. There were people playing with guns, young people playing with guns, and it always ends in something that's not so good. And I would love to say, lastly, before I call up Mr Talley-Thompson, there's been 100% graduation rate with our safety ambassadors to date, So that deserves a hand clap. so i'll call up the. he certainly the brains and he's the quarterback of our safe passage project. mr tali thompson, how you doing. thank you for coming good, so just kind of jump right in. the safe passage program to to me is one of the most comprehensive collaborations that i've ever been a part of in my life. you know the way it got started with the buell foundation, making that initial investment in in community, where you know the model was pretty much that you had to get community members inside the schools to actually be a part of doing that work and then being able to get the students involved with actually doing the work as well- teaching them. the model was something that was extremely important. and then all of the collaborations with the different non-profits, the grassroots non-profits from infinite lifestyle solutions, one nation mentoring, arbor league and, obviously, you know, operation better block, and then also, what was a part of the secret sauce, as i, as i, as i like to say, you know, we started out in perry- and i have to give an amazing shout out- i'm glad she's here today- but what kind of took it to the next level is that when miss o'malley became principal at perry. so once we got that buy-in from the principal where we started the program at which was, you know, thanks, you know, to miss o'malley- it just kind of took it to another level. but there's always been this collaboration as well with pittsburgh public schools. i think this may be the one of the first times in my history of there actually being an mou between a non-profit, the city of pittsburgh government and actually pbs, and they were 100 committed when and had two amazing individuals, dr sacco and jason rivers, and you'll hear from them. to be honest, i just kind of wanted to throw that introduction in, but what you see behind me is the, the collaborative work, with our most comprehensive collaboration that the city has ever been a part of and that's what everybody that's actually in this room right now is a part of safe passage and making safe passes. you know, the program is that it is today. so, with that being said, i think it's less of me and more of of them, because they're the ones that actually do the heavy lifting. so, councilman, we'd like to call up. we have four students to talk about the pillars and we'll talk. we'll bring two up at a time, okay, is it okay if they come to the table? yeah, for sure, please. okay, let me stay here. okay, the first two, come on, let's go two, two, two ambassadors- no, no, let's go two at a time, right here on this side. please introduce yourselves, discuss the pillar and then also how this has. have you kind of escaped dealing with violence? okay, my name is anaya paulino and i'm from alderdice high school. safe passage is really a really strict but comfortable program for most of the students in our school. we come in, we conversate, we do activities to took a like to take our mind off of school and the stress that school has on us because it's getting towards the end of the year. most of our safe passage members are seniors so they come in, relax and just try to get positive views and leave out happy instead of irritated from school, basically. but safe passage really does help a lot of students outside of our program, like many students that aren't members. they come in if they have issues. they come to everyone that's in the the program for issues. for example, I had a conflict between friends that like we're gonna get into altercation, but I had stopped it because I had a mediation between them to try to get solution between just social media stuff, just negative social media words comments. it's been going around the school. we got to a fair solution where they just separated and now the group is totally fine. Hi, my name is Kimmy McKenday. I go to University Preparatory and I'm a safety ambassador. I'm a senior, I'm graduating June 12th. if y'all want to be there, The program to me is a safe space. I'm not a violent person. I know violent people and the Safe Passions ambassadors are the ones that try to kill the disease of violence. We do activities, We try to diffuse situations. We're really just trying to change the community, make everybody's life better. My pillar is changing community norms. I'm trying to change the way everybody acts. The norm shouldn't be violence period. It shouldn't be: if you're upset, you harm somebody else, or if you're hurt, you hurt someone else. It should be: everybody should come together, Everybody should, everyone should. everyone should be able to live in a safe space. thank you very much. give them a hand, please. next to please, please, introduce yourself a little bit about the program and what pillar you took we'll be talking about. oh, make sure you do the mics. yeah, just tap it. there you go. my name is the army Mobley, I'm a junior at Perry and the pillar that I'll be talking about is providing identities, because I want the young people in our school to be able to know like they'll be able to be heard and not feel like they're being brought down by other students in the building just because of the fact that they might not have the same things that just all the other students in the building. My name is Alicia and I'm a senior at Perry High School and I'm actually one of the first people to get into the Safe Passage program. I've been in a Safe Passage program since ninth grade- not even though I was a little bump, because I'm the reason why we have the safe passage program. like I'm not gonna make it seem like, you know, it's just our peaches and cream. you know everybody has their ups and downs. you know, like even even helped me. you know, like I was one of the people that was fighting. you know, not even gonna ask if in class and it, lucky like, helped me in in a way because I got Bodie. I had Miss Danny and let's give the biggest shout out to Miss O'Malley because it wouldn't even happen without Miss O'Malley. The people that I'm gonna be talking about is resources, because everybody needs somebody to talk to and we're young so we like to keep everything bubbled up. Like you know, we don't like to talk to people and it's better for people to talk to people their age, because not everybody our age wants to talk to people. Like, not everybody our age wants to like talk to adults. You know they'll feel more comfortable talking to somebody around their age or somebody that's been through something that they've been through. We also did like summer programs where, like we had Ms Markeia and we did like yoga. We did like little girls groups. You know she gave us like little gifts. you know, like self-care, self-respect. We also went on a trip to Atlanta and we went to like a conference meeting. You know we met different people from all around the cities and countries. You know we met people from New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Jersey. We met people from all over the city And it just brings out like a very good impact on students and even teachers themselves because they see that we can change. you know, People always think like, hmm, like I don't see no good in them, but everybody has good in them. everybody could change and make a way. and I have a shirt- no, not to like to my horn, but I have a shirt and it says: you don't get what you wish for, you get what you work for, basically meaning it's not gonna come to you. you got to put in the blood, sweat and tears to be successful. I'd like to mention that we are joined by Councilwoman Strasburger and councilwoman gross. so excellent, thank you. we'll now have councilwoman. our two coordinators will come up just to talk about, because they are the, the glue that helps hold our young, young people together. you guys can go. thank you so very much. yes, my name is Darryl go. I'm the safe court passes coordinator at Perry high school. it was a pleasure with tally. Thomas called me and said he wanted to make a change into a school that we kept from. we both graduated from Perry high school and we want to make a difference. when O'Malley came up and been impressive, what made a big change in our program. we were able to do more things and we work together as a team. like we have problems, we have people that will call us and I will call Molly and before I get to the school, we'll be able to handle situations before it's our building instead of like if it's a fight on the streets. by the time we get back to school Monday we already know about it, so we'll be able to attack the problem before it gets there. and the collaboration with everybody in this room has been great and it's a pleasure to work for a safe answer program and we're all making a difference and we get support that we need. y'all- y'all can see the pudding's in the right end. we got proof of the things that we have done. we took kids to atlanta, we went to seattle, we just came from the sandy program that was in philadelphia. so we are seeing our kids are going to see different things that they never had an opportunity to see before and, like i said i had a mentor that changed my life, and that's the thing i want to do to the kids that i work with: change their lives, thank you, hello everyone. my name is maya lowry. i am a safe passage coordinator at older dice high school, so being the glue every day. I'm a community member, come from where these kids come from, so I see myself within them. safe passage of is allowing these kids to have the resources that they may not have at home. allow them to get a paycheck every month, regardless of what it's for, if it's closed, if it's for food. we're actually helping these kids within school, but also outside of school. so the pillar that I connect with a lot is providing identities and changing community norms because we're changing the culture at older guys. the violence it's nothing like it was before safe passage. we have teachers coming to us every day and connecting with them just to stop the violence before it gets to escalating into the neighborhoods. we are partner with reach, so if there is something that is going on within the school and the violence is going to be out in the neighborhood, I can stop that. 10 o'clock in the morning, 8 o'clock in the morning before it, the valets is to the neighborhood and children are involved. also, like i said, it's just every day working with these children. it's it's something new, but it's exciting and it's rewarding because these kids look forward to coming to school. i mean, i've literally had students that have one point gpas who are now graduating with 3. 0 and they're attending school and they love to come to school and safe passage is a part of that. so i enjoy the work that i do. i love the work that i do and these kids need this program. i mean, i do, of course it's my job, but it's about the kids because they're our future. thank you, what's this real quick? what's the pillars you speak of? because council may not be clear when y'all talk about pillars. okay, connect the community norms, like working with the community, being inside the communities and being able to take things from the community, the school and bringing it. just a quick overview of the four pillars that you do teach the two, oh, identity, identity, Providing identity, connecting community, changing community norms. So the pillars that he's speaking of is our safety model that we, of course, teach the kids and the kids have to know being safety ambassadors. So providing identities and detecting and identifying high risk individuals within the community that we're working in, which is the school buildings that we're working in. So every day we're working out the safety models, we're making sure our safety best model so that, when going throughout the building, if they need to detect and interrupt the situation and defuse the situation, they're able to do that. if they need to provide identities to the friends that they know or you know high-risk individuals are, you know, into violence, they can help us connect with them so that the violence can be diffused. so that's our safety model and it's we're staying by it, thank you, and we're bringing everybody together. like some of our safety ambassadors. they get together. we have like events where we all get together and it's built to build community things. so when they see each other downtown, okay, we know them from being for the safe passage, so it stops a lot of the problems that's going on. so, like between schools- you mean in different schools, different schools, yes, yes, we have everybody come together. we do different events with everybody so everybody can know each other. so if they see each other, that's like, okay, that's one of my safety bachelor's sister or brother and it changes and it helps out and, like i said, they make sure we know everything that's going on so we can do things in the neighborhood that we need to do it. thank you very much. thank you. thank you, councilwoman. we now have a dr, nino sacco, and jason rivers also bring up reverend cornell jones, because he and jason rivers kind of do the same thing. am i good to start? am i good to go? okay, so one of the things that just go ahead and introduce yourself, i'm sorry. yes, good afternoon, nina sacco. assistant superintendent for pittsburgh public schools. so one of the things that we thought was really important at the beginning of this program was creating a memorandum of understanding with the city of pittsburgh that really allowed us to see the vision to fruition, to really realize the work that tali and david were hoping we would see happen. so we really focused on what our systems would be and how we were going to shift culture within the eight schools that had been identified. our mou very clearly identified our meeting times and spaces, which we met once a week, every friday, for about three hours. i would say initially what we found with those meetings that, as they progress, not only were we able to identify spaces where we needed to provide supports, but we were also able to identify ways in which culture change could come about, with systems changes within the buildings, and how we could collaborate with the city of pittsburgh in other areas. what became really just kind of glaringly important to us was that there was a level of trauma that also needed to be addressed within the schools which we were aware of, but how we would do that, utilizing really- and i'm going to use the term- brilliance of some of our students who live this every day right. so how were we able to work with our students to then make sure we as the adults were bringing our best selves forward and providing the best resources and recognizing how we could create change for for our kids? and that's where i'm. i'm going to turn it over to mr rivers, who's going to talk a little bit about that part. all right, good afternoon everyone. my name is jason rivers, project manager for pittsburgh public schools. i oversee the work that we do in the arena of violence prevention and intervention. safe passage, as you know, has been shared, the collaboration between entities around. you know how we think about safety and wellness inside of our school buildings, inside of our communities, and how this ecosystem communicates with each other, and so this collaboration has allowed the opportunity. when we talk about trauma, complex trauma that families are dealing with, students are dealing with at times, staff members the fatigue that they're dealing with, and even as we talk about post-pandemic, you know there's a lot of things that communities are still trying to stabilize on and this collaboration allows, you know, research speaks to. you know, where there's three caring adults around a young person, how the trajectory, the life trajectory, is significantly changed. so when we think about hope- and hope is the word that comes to mind for me- when we talk about this collaboration and investment, investment can come by way of, you know, economic resources, and i think the greatest capital that this collaboration has is relationships, being able to get in front of concerns that young people have or that parents have. even staff people have to know that we're interrupting snitch culture where it's safe to communicate when i i'm having an issue with somebody else and i don't know what to do about that, and, and you know so, the the program's built on those sort of pillars. we do monday safety calls where you know if there's anything that occurred over the weekend. you know we can get in front of those things for the impact of school, because we know, sometimes things from community carry into school and then vice versa, things can carry from community back- i mean, excuse me- from school back to community. so this, this collaboration, has been invaluable and i think about the increased hope and excitement that has been built in mitigating, you know, violence, instability. so we we know we have a work to do, but to hear the stories of young people, the excitement that they have from the collaboration and program and the inner communication between schools and principal, where critical information is being shared, where there wasn't systems in place for those sort of things to happen and in the past. so you know, salute to all the leaders that have made it occur and, and most importantly, to the young people who do a phenomenal job and showcasing their brilliance and giftedness. the last thing i'll just say is: you know, i think another thing that the program and young people exhibit is we talk a lot about, like post-traumatic stress, right, and many of our community members of experience Issues around complex trauma. we tend not to talk about post traumatic growth and there's so much growth around resiliency and hope, and you heard some of those stories exhibited today, And so I'm excited to have a small part of the, the work has been done and as it's a delight to hear the young people talk about the change in impact that has had on their lives. what's important as far as our collaboration, councilwoman, is that mr Rivers is to PPS with Reverend Cornell Jones is to the city of Pittsburgh. so thank you, sir. greetings every everyone. hello. it's been exciting to see- I was there at the meeting that was at Perry High School and Dinah Bucco called people there to be able to talk about some of those situations and to see a new principle, a new vision and these things come together has been. it's been empowering and exciting at the same time. i remember when, when the conversation was with tali to be able to find those key individuals that could actually come into the schools that have the relationships, and now that to see that those key individuals are there and the work is being there. and- And I was blessed to be able to see some of the students in Seattle when we were at a violence prevention conference and these young Safe Passages students were like on the forefront of leading conversations about what they're doing And up to the point where other people and other organizations were like yo, we wanna learn more. That made me very proud to be able to experience that and to be able to say that they're part of Pittsburgh. You know what I mean. So, like, our collaborations are everything, even to the point where if something is about to happen, if something happened in the school, they'll they'll send out a notification to let me know and let certain people know- jason, dr sacco, director jones and and school police, to be able to let them know what's going on. and this is this is this is a 24 hours thing, so we're able to jump on things, to be able to strategize, so, as tali was talking about, so when the morning hits, we already got a strategy together and then, once again, we then tie into some of our city social workers, we then tie into the center for victims, we tire into what i like to call the village as much as possible to be able to pull these resources together. i've, as tali said, i've never seen a collaboration like this. you know what i mean. i've never seen it. and it's funny because when we were outside in the hallway, you would think that we all worked for the same organization, but because that's how much we're used to working together, we were used to, you know, in a drop of a dime. you know we talk every monday morning. you know we deal with each other on a regular basis, what? and that's the social worker, that's all of us working together to find out what it is to be able to tap into the resource that we need for the young people, for the young geniuses. and then we end up getting, you know, the, the young people who are part of safe passages program. we respect the genius that's in them. so if they're saying that we need to add resources and, for example, like, we found out that we needed to add some support to carrick because of the, the, the stress that they were having losing multiple students, so, like those are from conversations and guess what, we pulled the team together to be able to work up there and help the teachers up there. so these are: we're utilizing the geniuses that are in these young people and then the safe passage staff and, just you know, utilizing that, still working together with the reach program, utilizing the, the law enforcement piece, then utilizing the strategies that we have and pulling it all together. and it's been amazing, thank you. thank you so much. i can't go any further and we just have a couple more councilmen. miss molly is the principal from perry. we need her just to come. she's been our one of our hugest, biggest cheerleaders in this effort and we'd be remiss without having her, and she's been in this the longest with us. so i think, as i'm listening, i don't want to repeat, but i think where i'm going to kind of focus is resources, and then i'm going to talk about mediation, and so for me, the, the biggest benefit is the resources that our school is connected to outside in the community, and so things happen in school. it's part of school, it's part of daily life. but to be able to connect to outside entities and stop anything further from happening in the neighborhood is invaluable. Since I've been principal of Perry, which is this is my third year- last year we had one incident that started in school that carried over, and this year I think we just had one, And prior to me and this program being in Perry, I don't think that was the case- And so connecting and me having access to- well, I have access to Jason, sorry, but to mr Thompson, to mr Jones- it's just invaluable and it links us together. when we think, when I think of schools, I think school should be the hub of the community. that's just my personal opinion, and so this program has created that. and then the linkage between us and outside the city is just invaluable, and I would keep saying that, but it truly is. the next I want to highlight: changing the norms of your school. and so what does it look like when you change norms? if you're an educator, you know that in behavior management- behavior management system- the highest level is when students can redirect other students and they can receive that redirection. and so we're not a hundred percent there, but we're. we're definitely moving forward. students have a bigger impact on other students, and so when you see a student stepping up and saying, hey, come on, that you know that late bells gonna ring, let's go, let's get moving. you know miss O'Malley, you want to hear her mouth, you know she wants us in class on time- that makes a more powerful impact than me saying, hey, come on, let's go to class. what Diami and Alicia didn't talk to you about- and I wish they would have, because they are probably the best mediators I've seen. I actually think they're better than some adults. I could pull them in in the hallway. they could absolutely know nothing about the situation that's happening and they could mediate the students so that it could stop anything from transpiring. and when you see that, you know that you're headed in the right direction. you know we say we don't expect perfection, I don't expect perfection out of anyone, but we strive for it, and so that's what I want see in our students and in our community what i think is important. and thank you, miss molly. i just want to reiterate that we've broken down the silos between this, the city and pittsburgh public schools. i mean we can walk in to any school at any time and feel welcome and be able to navigate. additionally, they can come to any of our places and everything is fine. i think the communication has been paramount. we also use new era 412 that the council has funded. that is also the communication system we use between our safe passage coordinators and our reach team. so when things happen in the school- whether it's potential violence or the balance has already occurred- they automatically connect with our reach workers so we can get things together, pulling Reverend Cornell Jones and if the police is necessary, that happens as well. so we've broken down the styles. this has been the amazing collaboration. I just want to reiterate that before we bring up dr Norm Conti. so the last thing that I wanted to add is: you know Jason Rivers and myself will end up going to we'll make a home visit, like a lot of times you'll hear us talking about custom notifications for so, from situations where we think that that young person might do something to get themselves and more trouble, gets himself or someone else in some type of danger, we'll go and visit a house, we'll go and talk to the family and that type of stuff and sit down and do an intervention right there. that's the of collaboration that we didn't have before and a lot of that connection came from safe passage program. so with that the families usually thank us because that connection is there to be able to help bring peace. so when, when, when they're talking about this collaboration notification, it's actually a system that was a part of the new era system that anytime that a risk level assessment is submitted that has a three or four, everybody that's actually here gets an automatic notification in their email right, saying a risk of a three or four has been submitted into the system. an automatic email starts notifying everybody that's at this table, from public safety to even the law enforcement at pittsburgh public schools and then the collaboration kind of starts happening right away where folks are responding off of a risk level assessment. that didn't happen until this collaboration of between the city and pbs and non-profits Will we be able to actually upgrade that system, to add that notification part to it. So I just wanted to be clear, because you know there's some language, but I want to be clear- that it's an alert system that if a three or four enters the system, an automatic email is hitting all of our emails. I'd like to add also the collaboration that exists, which you know started out as being really intentional with the development of the MOU, But it has created relationships where when we do get a threat assessment, you know an assessment from ARIC 412, when Mr Rivers and Reverend Cornell Jones go out, the level of violence that is prevented at times is- I mean, you're talking about life and death situations sometimes. So I don't think that that should be lost in this space. i don't. i don't want us to not call that out, because we have multiple examples of situations where both of these gentlemen have really worked at preventing something from happening that could have been catastrophic. so there's a part, and that exists here, that i just think needs to be called out on that. thank you, dr conti is with us from duquesne and councilman. we also have at the end. we have some handouts and we can send stuff to you electronically. that will talk about our data and I know that part is super important and so we have that covered. but he would also can also speak to that collaboration as well. first, thank you all so much for having me here today. like my good friend Cornell said, it was really cool out in the lobby. it was one organization and one family made up of so many different people, and to be here with so many of my good friends and the people I've gotten to work with is wonderful. I'm a professor at Duquesne University. I'm a co-founder of the Elsinore Bennu think tank for restorative justice. I had the honor and the privilege to work with this organization At Duquesne University. we're doing what we can to support this work. through our school of education, We're offering opportunities for our advanced students to work on analysis and evaluation and refinement and improvement of the program, giving what they have to offer and giving them the opportunity to learn in real time and real practice. with this situation. On top of that, our office of community engagement is working to look to help score funding for this program And personally myself, I'm working on a class called Performing History, Autobiography and Progress. We've got some really great actors and writers and we work with kids in the Safe Passages program and we're working sort of on the identity transformation piece, where we give these kids a chance to work with people they've seen in actual movies they like and who are listening to them and are getting them to tell stories, their stories, and getting them to see themselves as writers and artists- not that they have to be that professionally, but that's a part of their identity. and when you open up, whether it's kids, whether it's, in my experience, whether it's guys in jails, whether it's police officers, when you get people thinking in ways that they don't usually, when you use the arts and the humanities, you get some results that you probably wouldn't expect. so we've been doing that with students in the past couple years at a number of the schools and we're also working with some accidentally. we're working with some of your safety ambassadors through 412 boxing. we're running the same program, performing history on ira in progress with them and we're putting together a book that's hopefully going to include a number of all the kids, and it's something like writing fighters or fighting writers, right, because all these- all these boxers first- are fighting right, and all the safety ambassadors. they're fighting for their community, right, and they have such amazing stories to tell and i think i don't know them that well, but i know some of these kids and the kids that are probably the best at this negotiation and this about this intervention. they're probably great storytellers. so, again, thank you so much. personally, i'm thrilled- i know duquesne- with our commitment. the university is thrilled and it's just wonderful to be a part of this councilman. that our presentation. we appreciate your. yes, I was going to do that again as well. yes, everyone that is involved, please, with safe passage. I was going to get to our data has been prepared by Tori and Casey and we have our other directors back to. can you guys please stand, because Tally's been nudging me for the past 45 minutes. this is just the staff that does the heavy lift and you know I, you know I have a pleasure of working with director Jones, but these are the folks that are in the school really, you know doing a lot of that hard work and go ahead. miss King is the director of the safe passage program. i'm just the creator of it, dr danny. hello everyone, i'm danielle king. i'm the director of safe passage. it's been an honor to do this work. tally caught me back in. well, i actually met tally. i'm a student at duquesne as well and i met him some time ago at the think tank when i was pregnant and he called me some time ago to do this work and I love it. I'm actually, you know, like I said, a student at Duquesne. so I'm doing this work, real time learning how to improve. you know, learning, I don't know, just different ways to support my community, empower them, parent engagement- that's what my dissertation is on. so just trying to think of more ways to get families involved and parents involved. when we talk about, you know, being surrounding kids, that is academic work. a child is in the middle and surrounding that child we have the family, the school, in the community and we all have to intertwine for the best of the child. so that's the work that we're doing and this is all proven. God willing, should be dr king in august. yes, i don't want anyone in the back mad at me. is anyone else? our kids, our coordinator that works with, like several of the young ladies schools. you want to come speak real quick because, like i said, i'm i'm just blessed to work with director jones, but these are the folks that are really in the trenches, you know, and it's important to recognize them aired to come and speak today. but my name is marquia lowry and i am the female and coordinator and i work across four schools: arlington university prep, westinghouse and older dice- and it has been a pleasure working with our female ambassadors. that's been my focus since i've been on board with obb and we talk about the impact that this program makes, but each individual ambassador has made an impact on me personally. i know someone mentioned- i think it was one of our perry ambassadors mentioned- that they're viewed as lost causes and they're really not. there's so much potential, so much talent that i get to bear witness to every single day working in these schools and they are making drastic change and I give them the space to be them and sometimes that's all they need to fill the hope, to fill the love, to fill the encouragement to work the model and to be amazing individuals, because they all truly are. yeah, Rick and Casey, but I don't know. we got Rick, we got one in one. more student ambassador, right, two more. come on, come on, let's do this quickly. councilman, thank you so much for your indulgence. i'm getting hijacked by one of my. i apologize. well, i'll go. rick butler, i'm a safe passage coordinator at older ice high school. i think the biggest thing for me is just like being able to build the relationships with kids and then actually see it come to come to fruition, for them to do different things like we got. pat been with us probably since the beginning of the program, probably- i don't want to make his head big, but one of my favorites because i just seen the transformation in him and his behaviors and the way he's disciplined, you know, with him getting involved in other things outside of school. and we just had a kid who's graduating this year who was walking around with like a one, three, one, four last report period, like a three, three, two or three, three, something like that. you know i'm saying his focus is like crazy right now. so i mean just able to see that, see things like that and see them actually being involved in things like real big for me. my name- my name is patrick germain. i'm from alderdice. one big thing about the group for me is like providing identities because, like i was able to do that like after like joining boxing outside of school, and like it just opens up so much opportunities for your future when you're boxing and stuff and this group right here. so, like, for me, i'm ranked number seven in the country now and i'm trying to get that, that number one. i ain't gonna lie, we got nationals coming up. So you know, yeah, you know what I'm saying. yeah, Young man, Hello, My name is Jaheim Jeffries. I'm coming from Older Dice High School And for me, a big thing about the program is changing community norms. seeing like Rick as a black man coming to the school every day- and you know, going to work is a big thing because there's not a lot of African-American men in the school present- But also, I would say preventing identities as well, because every like, like the kids from you prep said being a lost cause. i guess there's no such thing as a lost cause in the school, because if you're going, if you're waking up each morning, showing up for school, you can't be a loss, because that's the first thing. and i feel like providing identities is just real big on that, because there's something for everyone. i feel like, even if, like for safe passage, a lot of people out here safe passage and they hear the four pillars and like, oh, we don't want to do that, like that's long, you know, it's still a safe space for people to come together to stop the disease of violence. thank you, all right. thank you everyone, any questions? because we have some, some handouts we'll give. we can also send to you electronically any question. any questions. yeah, go ahead members. yeah, all right. thanks, thanks, council member Barbara Warwick for hosting this post-agenda hearing, and thank you everyone who spoke. I really apologize that I missed the first 15 minutes as I was getting out of another meeting, So I missed some of the introductory remarks and maybe some of the testimonials. but this is, you know, this kind of collaboration and this on this exact issue area is exactly what we need and it's obviously borne out. We've already seen. I'll look at the data, but the anecdotal data, I think qualitative data also important to see that it is. it is changing lives on daily basis. so great, great work everyone. i i hear about different programs and i don't always understand how they interact, so i'm just going to ask the question. this is its own program. you're all operating as if you're under one roof, one entity, and that's exactly, i think, what we need. then i also hear speaking of Perry, and you know I heard Diana Bucco's name. I also know that a plus schools has their program on truancy and attendance and sort of figuring out strategies for in each high school, working with teachers and working with the principal to try to wrap the community's arms around the schools. I'm wondering how this program interacts with that program, if at all, or if they're just kind of, if they're integrated at all, they're separate, if they're just existing side side. we've worked with a plus schools, we've met with we, so we work with a plus schools. they were a part of language, i mean meetings when we were, you know, discussing language and implementation. so a plus school was actually at the table as i was working with the buell foundation on the implementation plan. so and and then also, you know, depending on which you know school in particular, miss o'malley could probably speak to the way that she creates collaboration between all the programs that are within her school, and that was something that we was intentional about. is that we, we didn't want to for safe passage to come into existence, right, and then say that you no longer need the other programs, that that that are within your building. so it. so safe passage in itself is a model that collaborates with other programs and non-profits that are already in the school and we just kind of use our model to fit them into the work that they already do. so when we started, you know, safe passage if there was a school, let's say, one nation mentoring was up at beshear, right, the principal. but she says, ty, we would like for that individual or their team to be our safe, our safe patches coordinators, right. so we just kind of taught them the pillars to teach the students that that they're working with, and then add safety ambassadors on. so now you end up having getting more. you already had one nation mentoring. now there's a collaboration between us and safe passage and one nation mentor, now you get more. the goal was that this collaborative language was was going to- because actually that's what it takes to be able to change the culture inside these schools- is these collaborative relationships. it can't be one thing in and another thing out, like that's called the hamster in a wheel, where you're replacing one thing with another. it has to be this and that. thank you. what i would also like to add to that is: no, i just wanted to add one thing with the breshear example, tali also brought on someone from casa san jose to work with some of our students at breshear. so there is that, you know, through all of the collaboration that we're doing on our end, when one of us recognizes something, as he did, like hey, this, we need to bring someone on from this organization at breshear because they have these relationships with students, and then we're, you know, we're able to do that based on all the various collaborations and different programmings. sorry, director, no problem. additionally, our safe patches coordinators know the other programs that are in the school and organically, i mean, they certainly get our assistance, but they they talk because they're also from the community as well. that's great. that's great to hear there was, i, I think, someone who wanted to speak. Do you want to come up to the microphone? Thank you All. good, you can just speak With the A-plus community. we also, Baldy and I, at the beginning of every school year we collaborate with them by going to the homes within the north side and delivering book bags to the incoming freshmen. So we've been doing that collaborative for what? the past two, three years. So they're definitely somebody we work with. Yeah, thank you, And that's just. you know, the APLS example is one example, but I heard other examples: Casa, San Jose and others that are in there too. so great to hear that each school is sort of determining how best to coordinate. We even had Arbery actually pays for half of our safety ambassadors at Perry right And that was through the support of Diane, where, as we continue to get more and more support, other organizations wanted to actually take on a responsibility of funding some of the safety ambassadors. So when I say it, I'm being sincere when I say this is one of the most comprehensive collaborations that I've ever been a part of in my history of doing this work within the city of Pittsburgh. Can I add, Ty, too, that because of the work and because of the collaboration that we've been doing, there's an organization called Cities United that we work with. in fact, some of the students that are here- a lot of us- have actually gone the conferences where all the violence intervention teams from across the country come like they're gonna, because they heard about the collaboration in july. they're talking about coming here and looking at what we do because they're hearing about the collaboration as like a collaboration like no other, so that's exciting news, then. that's something that i think we should be excited about, because a lot of they're hearing about how the city in the county, how safe passages, the reach program, all of us from the city and all that type of stuff are working together, is strategically when in unity, because a lot of times, a lot of cities don't do that, and that's something that we've seen. when we go into these conferences, they will. there's issues because over money, a lot of times and things such as that, as i said before, we were outside as one. you know what i mean- and that's something that people are hearing about across the country, and cities united is something that, if you look it up, you'll see that this is a national program that's doing amazing work, and for them to look at us as being like one of the models so that they can bring other cities to see, i think is important for us for you guys to know about. yeah, absolutely Okay, thank you. One final question, and that is this: really integrated collaboration's been like the word of the day. it's like so integrated, and I am really impressed by that and I'm wondering if maybe to our PPS representatives or our others, if you think there's room for this to occur in other realms. so this is the trauma, interruption or intervention, restorative justice realm, when it comes to, say, out of school time, city and PPS right and how we integrate more around that. Do you think there's? this is a leading question, but do you think there's room for that? Is there capacity? is there room, is there an opportunity or an appetite for that? those kinds of conversations in other realms Go ahead. I think there's always room for that. I think using the model or how we approach this work, because really, when we reflect upon how we got to this space and how these relationships sort of built organically, it really came out of that beginning where we sat down and said, okay, what's important to PPS, What's important to the city of Pittsburgh, to OBB, How do we put that in a document that's gonna hold all of us accountable? Then the beauty: it became more than just accountability. the beauty in that was all of the people sitting around the table really saw the potential in this, wanted to make a difference, wanted to see culture change and were just so invested and committed in the work itself And that extended beyond just our small group, you know, and Jason too, he's back there- and Danielle- But that we modeled that for the schools. So this was our expectation When we we would meet with schools regularly, go in and we'd have meetings with the principal and, you know, the coordinators and the kids and whomever in the schools. but at the same time we were also modeling for them our relationship and how closely we worked with one another. and so i think there is room. i think that the intentionality and the authenticity really needs to be their invulnerability. people need to be okay with being vulnerable in the spaces. i know somebody also think: what is important if you talk about our stop the violence grantees. so what we've done intentionally is breaking down the silos, giving them some, some money so they're all working together, you know, throughout the zones, cross zones, throughout. so, yes, that is, there's always room for collaborative efforts across the board. that's one of the things that we've been trying to push: breaking down the silos, increasing the communication and working together in a deep, meaningful manner. thank you, council members. those are all my question. thank you all. thanks, councilwoman. thank you, councilwoman. so i am so impressed. i'm so really deeply moved and impressed by all of the work that you all have put in. thank you so much, and i have given dr jones some hassle over the years. that's kind of excuse, that's kind of our job on this side of the table, right. so i'm thinking back. it was three or four years ago when, you know, i was like where is the data? and now we've got it in our hands, right, where are? and i think you'll remember this one keenly- there was a room full of just men and i said: where are the female mentors? they're with us today and i see them and i'm so glad to see the female students and the female mentors and i really appreciate that. and so it takes time to put these kinds of programs together, but also it really takes. I heard the word genius and said about the students, the genius leaders here, and I think I don't know but I wonder if, like that was your turning point, like it seems like you, really you have student leadership here and and I see that things have not just pulled together but blossomed and grown and beyond blossom like grown trees, and I don't even know all the metaphors I'm reaching for you, I'm not that good at that, but that this is a really robust program that is making a really, really substantial difference, clearly, and so really, I can see that in your stories. I can. I can hear that your stories, I can see that the people I see in the room, and I can see it on the numbers as well. so thank you for having the numbers. I I also want to admit that before I walked in here, I did not understand how big this had gotten. I think a few years ago we were talking about getting kids safely on their buses home. Okay, good, Okay, am I really that kind of out of sync with what's happening? That is not what we're talking about here. Like you all are creating. I don't even know what to say. we've talked about collaboration, we've talked about community, but we're talking really about like a new- almost like it feels like a new- Pittsburgh. It feels really big. So I really appreciate that right, The kinds of problems that we would hear about at this table, that they seemed too big, But now we've got- it sounds like you've got- solutions that have met their moment. right, You've created really, really big solutions for what were really really big problems. So thank you, Because it takes a little bit of a leap of effort and it takes your time and your energy and your love and your effort to keep it going and to do all that, And I can really feel that everybody in the room did that. So I really, really appreciate that. So I mean again to recap, I took several pages of notes, right, I heard everything from performing history and storytelling to really working on the trauma of not just students but also teachers and staff and really kind of addressing all of the healing to that. everybody had more right: You have to take care of yourself first, so you have more to give. right, that literally the kind of core group was spending every Friday together, because it takes a lot of- there's like a thousand or more things to do when you're kind of like turning a big ship and you're turning and you're changing those cultures and you're changing the way people have been doing things for decades, or or and creating something new that you you know you don't know what it is that you need to create, but you know you need to create something- but also connecting the kids in our schools to resources, even jobs and outside programs, again coordinating with the other kind of charitable efforts that have been going on for a long time but didn't have really hadn't manifested the kind of change that they had hoped to be right, and I know the leaders of a post schools, I know the leaders of the real foundation and I know what they have been trying to do and have done in other realms. but to see it happen so broadly and in such a big way and in like eight of our schools is really amazing. so I don't want to take up much more time because I think the value here today was really hearing the stories. I'm getting it in the public record again, just if you didn't know. this is like an official council meeting, so this is in the record forever. right it is. you'll be able to pull it up on legislative database and this is kept in our vault of video kind of minutes and because it feels historic too. so i appreciate that. so i'm not going to take any more time, madam chair, i appreciate it, thank you. thank you, councilman, for your words. thank you very much, yeah, thank you. So, yeah, this is all incredibly impressive. And one thing I did have a well, so one thing I was- I don't know if you feel comfortable for our ambassadors in the room- if you wanted to share, and again, only if you feel comfortable, but of an example, because I'm interested in maybe an example of how So you're working in the schools, sort of managing incidences, mediating, but do you have any examples of how you have brought that you know home into your community, sort of outside of school time, whether that's in the summer or on the weekend or whatever? like these skills have they ever helped you? I don't know if you have any, if any of you wanted to share. Since going to Otterdijk, a lot of us come from the same communities, like Hazelwood's a big one. A lot of the Hazelwoods. A lot of students from older guys go to Hazelwood. I mean come from Hazelwood and I'll say a lot of things that happens in school will travel outside of school. but I'll say this as a safety ambassador: if they see me, or if they see me and they know if I say something like, oh, come on, everybody, just chill out, it's not cool, that will stick into someone's head because even if I just say it to one person, if he goes and says it to one more person, it spreads. like that it can stop the disease of violence, just like that. Yeah, anyone else, Yeah, go ahead. Can you repeat the question one more time. Well, just if you can think of an example where sort of what you've learned in this program at school, participating in this, has helped you out sort of in the world in your own life, whether on the weekends, at night, in the summer, whatever, just in your own community, When I'm outside on a normal day and I just see people just on some stuff, Like I, just like you know I be trying to help them out. you feel what I'm saying? Like I don't know, like now, like like when people doing bad stuff, or like you know what I'm saying. like cussing and stuff it just like it's like it just gross me out. you know what I'm saying. I gotta help them out. you feel what I'm saying. Get them on track. you feel me? Yeah, that's about it. Great, I feel like being a part of this and since I get paid to do it, it's my job to like interrupt things before they escalate to something bigger, because I go to you prep, so anything that happens in school will be an even bigger thing out of school. everything has to be a bra like. if you don't interrupt it, everybody's going to be in the situation. so should I say a story? are you an example. it's a couple examples. we have to get a little bit there. there were two girls, younger girls, because i don't know why, but like all the younger girls are starting to be like the disease they're, they're the infectors, like everything that happens is within them. i feel like we've, like the older kids from, i think, the seniors that graduated last year from safe passage. safe passage has impacted them so much that the kids that are coming out they don't do like the stuff they used to do. there's not as much violence with them. nobody wants to go out school and fight because we're all getting older, we all have learned like it's not doing anything for us. so these girls, they were probably fighting about a boy or something. it wasn't, it wasn't anything that couldn't be solved. so I think I seen them in the hall one day and they're arguing. but it's like their friend group is arguing and the other girl's friend group is arguing and I'm like it's getting to the point. it's about to be a big thing. everybody's running up there to see they're about the fight and I'm just like I pulled the girl to the side and I'm like what are you gonna get out of this? like you're fighting her because of this boy and the boy, he's not gonna come and like, pick one of y'all, it's not gonna be a, I'll get you, I'll get you. y'all are just gonna be fighting. neither one of y'all is gonna have the boy after that or y'all still gonna have to share. so I'm like like what do you want to fight her for? she disrespected me, she said this, she said that, but it's about the boy. you're arguing about the boy. so I'm just like, like what if you get beat up? like you're just gonna fight her, somebody's gonna win, somebody's gonna lose, but it's not gonna solve the problem. you're still gonna argue and then it's going to get to the friends, it's going to affect everybody. they're going to be fighting. it'll be just a forever thing, ongoing, long going, and it would just never be peace. so I think that's the end of my story, like they didn't end fighting, they didn't know. and i think what's important to to what she's speaking to is that the pillars that we teach the ambassadors, the first one is interrupting the transmission of disease, of violence, and that's an example of when she kept saying that if she didn't interrupt that, then once it happened, she was saying how things become a brawl right and that's how that that disease kind of kind of you know, spreads. and also what's being clear is that she's just they're paid on a monthly basis. they're on obb's payroll each. all these safety ambassadors- we have 94 safety ambassadors on operations, better box payroll through this safe passage program where they're receiving 200 a month. and it's me that's important to make sure i'm clear about that is that the way that you know it worked. the grant worked. we thought we was going to be able to stipend them but because it came from the state, we had to actually put them on payroll. so we had 94 students currently, right now, as paid safety ambassadors on payroll. i also have another story, just like cammy's, but it was mostly outside of school. i, i would say i have a lot of friends and all the guys, i'm nice to everyone. i'm just someone everyone comes to and talks to if they have an issue. i will say there's a lot of issues when it comes with relationships. everyone, everyone is in everyone's business. when it comes to relationship, if you like someone, it's going to get around the school, it's going to get outside the school. it's like there's no stopping it. and there was this day where two of my friends it was. this happened way before I was in the program, way before. well, it was the beginning of the school. they had an issue where one liked the boy and when I was talking to a boy outside of school, she I wouldn't say snitched, but she told that boy that she liked her and it upset her. and during school, before it happened outside of school, during school, they were arguing and I'm I was just. I think I was sleeping at this point, but I woke up and I'm just like: why are we arguing? what are we arguing about? and they reminded me about something I talked to them about before. they brought it up to the teacher and other students are getting into it, just making the situation bigger. and I'm just like, guys, we've been through this, it's not that big of a deal. then, outside of school, I saw them arguing. while we were hanging out, they went to the side and started arguing. I'm just like, why are we arguing about this? we're outside, it's a nice day and we're all trying to be if, be all friends, be all cordial, but you know, children are really really, really hard to. I don't know they're, I will say freshmen and sophomores, like recent freshmen, are really hard to just like convince to stop arguing about the littlest things, especially when it comes to relationships, because they don't understand the big picture and they just want to fight, they just want to get over it. but what they don't know is just a continuous circle. it's a never-ending circle. you're just gonna keep arguing and fighting until you come to the realization that you're fighting over the most tiniest thing. so we kind of came to that solution which I explained when I first introduced myself, kind of came to the solution where they just separated it kind of diverse- the friend group a little bit. it's a little rocky now, but we're cool. the situation is calm. there's no ice, there's no nothing. everyone's just calm into themselves now. so I feel like the program really helps me help my friends and even outside of school people who are I'm not friends with, and even if I personally don't like them, I still would help them at the end of day with problems they have. so they realize that they don't have to fight and argue about it. they can just get over it and let it be what it is. thank you, thank you. so, yeah, one question: what is it? is there? is there an element of the program or maybe looking forward with sort of like a mental health component, sort of availability of therapy and or yeah, okay, i'm sorry. what we've done in the past is that we brought other organizations that specialize in that in to have sit downs with our ambassadors and it becomes a lot easier. one time in particular after the event with the, the airbnb on the north side right, that was a real traumatic event. so we had a relationship with, with centers for victim right, and they kind of came in with our ambassador, with our coordinators, and had had sessions, you know, had sessions. so what we end up doing is organizations that specialize in those different things. we kind of bring them in, you know, when we have those weekly meetings with our ambassadors, so that they can kind of have those conversations to where typically, if you don't bring them in through the pathway that they're always familiar with and sometimes they just kind of reject it may exist and it's there, but the kids may not kind of engage in it. so that's one thing we've been focusing on when it comes to trauma is bringing some of those trauma organizations in along with us to sit down with the kids on a weekly, on weekly basis when we have those opportunities too. additionally, we also have when there are severe acts of violence. in our schools we have social workers that also come in to work with the students. but that's also relational in that some of the social workers don't know our students, but if one of our members from safe passage or reaches there, that kind of that helps that introduction go a lot easier. so they'll sit down and speak with a social worker that they may not otherwise if these vehicles weren't in our schools. we also have. they spoke about the new era 412 system. it's not just our data management and system of accountability, but we also utilize it for external resources and referrals. so like we're connected with the 2-1-1 app and we can send these resources directly to the students phones. so there's so many reasons. one resources on there, so you can go on there, resolve UPMC, mercy, behavioral, so we can connect with all of those through the application as well. great, thank you, yeah, so I mean I just overall. you know we, you know we talk a lot about violence and crime in the city and and you know lots of it. you know there's gonna be a post agenda, I think, tomorrow night about you know or sorry, not a post agenda, a public hearing about violence. but I think that one thing that a lot of folks, certainly myself, kind of don't appreciate is that when we are talking about violence, and specifically gun violence that you know well, i mean, i guess i could ask a question: who here of folks in this room have had a family member or very close friend have lost a family member or close friend to gun violence, just like show of hands right, and how many people ha know more than one person who has been lost to gun violence, like in their immediate right? and that's something. so i you know, you know, since I've been in this role and I have- I represent Hazelwood, so I have some good friends and that is always something that you know just hanging out, you know, just going, you know just, and, and we have these conversations and friends say to me like, oh, my son, what you know was, you know people who have lost their children, people who whose children have been shot. maybe they didn't, but you know, and it's all pervades, it's like everyone, and that is so not the reality. for, for example, in my world right, and I think that we fail to recognize that when we are here in Pittsburgh talking about crime and violence, and you know, and I am so glad that, and for me, I find Pittsburgh to be very safe In my world. right, Pittsburgh is very safe. right in the neighborhood I live in, my kids walked, whatever, like you know. and so, and this is where the real danger is and that is what you are all working toward solving and you're getting it done, right, When we look at these numbers, when we look at, you know, a 27% drop in discipline events, a 14% drop of students involved in those events, you know a 7, you know an almost 8% drop in violence in just one year. right, that is actually solving and it doesn't happen all at once, right, and so, you know, we all talk. you know it's easy to sort of sit in your armchair and watch Stephen talk about what should happen, what could happen, you know. but you know, teachers are overwhelmed, parents are overwhelmed, kids are overwhelmed, I mean even even in, in any, in any, even myself, right, I'm sure my kids' teachers are overwhelmed and I, you know, and I'm overwhelmed. but when you add this reality of gun violence and maybe housing insecurity and maybe issues of mental health in the community, and you add all that together, this reimagining of public safety, and that is the thing. right? That is what we have been seeing here in Pittsburgh over the past two, three years. right Is this commitment to reimagining how we do public safety, and that is getting to the root cause. right, that is working together in a co-response way, like you said, breaking down the silos, because the police can't fix this alone, the schools can't fix this alone, the city can't fix this alone, the community groups can't fix this alone, the football coaches can't fix this alone. right, it takes everybody together, and i'm I'm just really so impressed, And I love even that you've got the technology too right with the apps. I mean, this is such an impressive effort And I'm really glad to hear that it's been recognized nationally. you know, I don't really have any questions. I just want to congratulate you all on the incredible work And thank you because you are doing the work to make pittsburgh a safer city. i just want to say to you: thank you so much, councilman, for hosting us. you have no idea i could have filled this room up with people that wanted to come and speak, but we tried to narrow down that we wouldn't overwhelm. but we appreciate you and the councilman for even just entertaining us today and hosting us. we appreciate that, thank you, thanks. oh, i guess with that i don't have my, my little script. okay, so, having exhausted the business of this post agenda, the meeting is adjourned. thank you.",Pittsburgh City Council hears how Safe Passage program cut school violence by 27% and prevented teen homicides through student ambassadors and city-school partnerships.,"• **Safe Passage program shows major success in reducing school violence** - The program achieved a 27% drop in total discipline events, 25% decrease in major discipline events, and 7% decrease in violent offenses in 2024 across seven high schools and one middle school.

• **Zero teen homicides in target age group during 2024** - There were no homicides among 13-17 year olds in 2024, which officials partly credit to Safe Passage work. However, two teen deaths occurred in 2025 from ""gun play"" rather than intentional violence.

• **Student ambassadors get paid to prevent violence** - The program employs 94 student ""safety ambassadors"" who earn $200 per month to mediate conflicts and interrupt violence before it spreads. All ambassadors have maintained a 100% graduation rate.

• **Program uses four main strategies** - Students learn to detect high-risk situations, interrupt violence, provide positive identities to peers, and change community norms that accept fighting as normal.

• **City, schools, and nonprofits work together daily** - Officials from Pittsburgh Public Schools, Department of Public Safety, and community groups meet weekly and respond together to threats through an alert system that notifies all partners immediately.

• **Students mediate real conflicts at school and home** - Ambassadors shared examples of stopping fights over relationships and social media disputes by helping peers understand that violence doesn't solve problems and creates bigger issues.

• **Program started after incident at Perry High School** - The Buell Foundation funded the initial effort, which later received state grants and expanded to eight schools with support from multiple community organizations."
