"PUBLIC COMMENT
   Dr. Ronald Lynn Miller, Yvonne F. Brown",NO_LEGISLATION,"Our next order of business is public comment. I would like to remind all speakers that the rules of council state that comments are limited to matters of concern, official action or deliberation which are or may be before city council and professional action. Thank you, Mr Schlemand. May I ask that City Councilwoman Please add another comment on legislation for the location of Michaelson's ovat 0670 Put-l. spiritual of Wasu fog. Dr Wilkes, even though you have to go online to get most of your information, Very, very nice sound. Your consular claimants are very focused on the vote, with good reason. There is a primary election tomorrow. The vote is the core of the US-American Republican democracy. That doesn't mean parties, It means institutions, But we citizens are not in control of our votes, So the vote is the central US-American freedom of speech action. But no voter in any election in the United States of America, as far as we know, can check the voting record to make sure that his or her vote or their vote has been misplaced, lost or misapplied, leached over to someone else that you didn't vote for. You can claim it- That's what I mean by claimant- But you can't claim it. You can't prove it. No one in this room can prove that you voted for yourself in any election in Allegheny County. So I and the Global Intelligence Society, my colleagues, have asked more than 1,000 people in Pittsburgh City across nine districts- all nine districts- and more than 10,000 across the United States country. three questions to begin with. One for people that are willing. Two: for people that are willing to engage, Of all racial backgrounds and ethnic backgrounds and so on. One: do you want your vote to be misplaced or lost? Answer: universally is no. Second question: do you want your vote to be misapplied to somebody else? Answer is, again, universally, no. And number three: can you check to make sure that your vote has not been misapplied or misplaced? And the answer is universally: in all, more than 3,200 counties or county equivalents in the United States? the answer is no. I think this is an egregious breach of our right to freedom of speech under the US Constitution, Amendment 1. This is why my 2028 President effort has Initiative 1, which is vote by voter verification- for whom The county here will allow you to check that you voted, but not for whom, And that is to get the US Supreme Court to rule that a citizen must have access to the vote record to ensure that his or her vote has not been misplaced, gone or misapplied, gone over to someone else. Thank you very much. There being no further registered speakers, we will now take comments from those in the audience wishing to speak. Thank you, Thank you. Thank you, Mr President, Thank you, Thank you, Mr President, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. My name is Javon F Brown. I live at 715 Mercer Street, that's in Cady, where Irv's tires up on Bedford Avenue. I repeatedly came down here and told you that we have a domestic terrorist, a woman that comes into the building and she's there to help us, and she's there to help us, and she's there to help us, and she's there to help us. And I have to tell you that I have been in the building for many years. to the building. It beat the mother and daughter with the hammer. It just beat another resident a little, a man that was kind of heavy, And I looked. he says just small as me, And I said: what kind of diet are you on? And he said cancer. This man has cancer. He was standing and talking to another resident And this woman, Rashida McKinley, walks down the hill, goes up under the tree and gets a branch and comes while this man is talking to one of the residents and whacks him in his head, just starts beating him in And he said: why are you doing this to me? Well, I go to the manager because I'm upset when they tell me And she says: oh, he has to go to. we can't do nothing, He must go to the police. And I'm saying: if you got cameras and she's been banned since 2020, 2022- I went up me and my daughter bought her a new car And she's been messing with me and some of the other people. This is 25. She's still chasing me. And when I go to the manager and say that, I'm afraid she said: don't say that. I said she's saying things to me. She put her big breasts up in the air. She don't talk to me like that. But some weeks later they heard somebody say: what did you say to my mother And her? some scaffolding. And that was her. Rashida McKinley had our manager by her neck, but she's thinner now. The manager threw her down. They were wrestling on the floor. She was saying: get her off of me, get off of me. The manager said I did not hit her. All I was doing is reprimanding her. Well, no, she said restraining, I'm sorry, Restraining. Well, I sweep down in the building. I've been doing it for years. And the manager came in and I said to her: when I told you that I was afraid for my life and told you that this woman is bothering me, you told me that she don't talk to you like that. I said: but she'll grab you by your neck. And she said I'm afraid. And I said I'm afraid. And she said I'm afraid. And I said oh, no, no, no, But there is witnesses. These are the citizens that told me. they saw them. And the one woman was sitting there and Rashida came out and told us, called her all them, called all the women, old bees, and how she's going to get us going to do this one to this, going to do this, And that I'm trying to explain to you that when we, when I first came down here, we came because we had no security. We didn't even mention her. Then we got security. Oh, it's been a while We had security. Well, the the the wit Watson, our county councilman, was in there talking and I was sitting there and he was bragging about what he did And I said we don't even have a bus. And he turned around and he started swimming. He said: I put your AFS out of the county council And I said no, you didn't. I was taken back, but I said no, you didn't. I am asking you to help me. I'm asking you to help me. I'm asking you to help me. I'm asking you to help me. I'm asking you to help me. I'm asking you to help me. I'm asking you to help me. Thank you very much.

  - Said a woman named Rashida McKinley has been banned since 2020 but continues to attack residents
  - Described incidents including beating a cancer patient with a tree branch and attacking a mother and daughter with a hammer
  - Said the building manager was also physically attacked by McKinley

DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ACTUALLY GOES INTO? WHAT THE FUND GOES INTO, THERE IS ACTUALLY AN HONEST ONE. WE HAVE A FUND THAT'S SET UP. OVER THE LAST HOW MANY YEARS WE HAD A FUND THAT WAS GOING INTO THE SAME FUND, AND WHEN WE HAD THE AUDIT AND I MET WITH THE GRANTS DEPARTMENT FOR THIS YEAR, WE REALIZED: CAN YOU HOLD YOUR MICROPHONE A LITTLE CLOSER, OH SORRY. WHEN WE HAD THE AUDIT EARLIER THIS YEAR, AND THEN I MET WITH THE GRANTS DEPARTMENT. WE REALIZED THAT A NEW FUND NUMBER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, AND SO THIS IS KIND OF GOING BACK, DOING OUR CHECKS AND BALANCES, REALIZING THAT WE NEED TO GET A NEW FUND. WHAT DOES AUTO THEFT AND AGENCY? DO DO YOU KNOW I MEAN WHAT DO THEY? SO IT'S SUPPORTED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY. SO WE RECEIVE MONEY WHICH PAYS FOR ONE OF OUR, THE SALARY OF ONE OF OUR DETECTIVES, PAYS FOR OVERTIME, PAYS FOR EQUIPMENT, PAYS FOR VEHICLES- OH, OKAY. SO THIS IS NOT LIKE SOMETHING IN BLACK AND WHITE THAT SAYS: DON'T LEAVE YOUR CAR UNLOCKED. NO, OKAY, THAT'S IT FOR ME. AS FAR AS THIS ONE GOES. ANYBODY ELSE. I HAVE QUESTIONS. COUNCILWOMAN KAYLE SMITH. I KNOW THAT. JOEY KENYA WAS THERE. JOEY GREW UP IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, SO I KNOW HIM, AND YOU HAD RECEIVED A GRANT FOR THIS AND YOU WEREN'T PAYING PEOPLE WITH THAT GRANT. THIS IS BEFORE YOUR TIME, SO I'M GOING TO LET YOU SLIDE. WE GOT THAT STRAIGHTENED. I'M GOING TO LET YOU SLIDE. DID YOU GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT? WE DID, BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T, I DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR ANOTHER GRANT. WE DID. I DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR MORE MONEY TO GO INTO A POT THAT WE DON'T SEE RESULTS FROM. SO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S BEING HAPPENING, YEAH. SO WE HAD A MEETING WITH THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE RECEIVED THE GRANT AND THEY HAD CONCERNS TOO, BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T SPENDING IT. NO, NO, NO, YEAH. SO IT WAS SITTING THERE. SO IF YOU DON'T USE IT, YOU LOSE IT. AND WE PROMISED TO STAFF THAT UNIT TO THEIR SPECIFICATIONS, AND WE JUST SO WE HAD. SO AFTER KENYA LEFT, WE HAD DETAILED A COUPLE DETECTIVES DOWN THERE TO HELP OUT, TO HELP OUT WITH THE UNIT, AND WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE UNIT, AND WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT HERE. ARE THEY HERE? NO, THEY'RE NOT HERE, OKAY, AND SINCE THEN WE TRANSFERRED ANOTHER DETECTIVE DOWN THERE, SO WE HAVE TWO. WE NOW HAVE TWO DETECTIVES. YEAH, WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF- AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT GRANT MONEY FROM THAT, THE PREVIOUS GRANT? DID YOU PAY FOR SOME BECAUSE JOEY KENYA LEFT, BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T HIRING PEOPLE AND THE MONEY WASN'T BEING USED FOR THE GRANTS? YEAH, WE DIDN'T, WE DIDN'T, WE DIDN'T. SO, YEAH, Did you pay for something? Because Joey Kenyon left because you weren't hiring people and the money wasn't being used for the auto squad? Yeah, so when he left, we had to be, And he became a civilian and makes more money and is as happy as can be, And they left Pittsburgh Police. That's a sad statement to me. Don't give him any ideas. It was a sad statement to me that you know somebody leaves here and they're just so much happier. Yeah, so after he, Because we failed to do our responsibility Right. So after he had left, that left us. So after he left, that left us down to one detective. and then we filled it via detailing officers. Who was the detective when he left? It was Derek Quince. Thank you, Detective Quince. At the time, Joe was there by himself. Quince was helping out on the firing range And then, after Joe had left. Derek Quince had come back and then we had somebody working with him. I think I can just say the administration is probably happy they sent you over here today because I was waiting for this to come before us. But I do appreciate that you are trying to straighten a lot of things out And I wish that we had had you in place for the last three years, because I see the work that you're doing and I see how you respect the officers and that means a lot to us. Contrary to what everybody thinks, we didn't chase anybody away, But I know if people like to say this the fact, but the reality is I have my text messages that prove otherwise. So, with that said, I will say thank you for your work and thank you to the officers for their work and thank you for your work. I'm sorry that there's such a challenging time right now in the city of Pittsburgh for the police and for various departments. Thank you, Thank you, Council Member Warwick. Yeah, thanks, I just wanted to quickly ask. so I know that this may not be, you know, specifically for this amount of funding, but I wanted to ask about about abandoned vehicles Because you know, I know in my zone, in Zone 4. I believe we have one officer and I just wanted- I know there's some issues with storage and whatnot- We just we do get a lot of calls about abandoned vehicles and I understand that it takes that. it's sort of a complicated process and if there's any, if you have any thoughts about what you know, what's going on, what can be done to kind of make this a faster process or what the what, the what sort of the pain points are around getting, you know, getting vehicles abandoned, vehicles towed, And I know too, I've also had situations with, like boats, you know larger vehicles, boats, trailers, that type of thing. So boats are a little bit of a trickier issue. However, to answer your question regarding the abandoned vehicles, in the very near future I have a plan to to have a abandoned vehicle blitz where we're going to hit each zone and try to clean up as many abandoned vehicles as possible. Oh, that's great. Can we? can we send you, because you know I have a lot? we have a long list between myself getting calls and also the office. you know we have a whole long list. Should we send that to you or should we send it to our commander? You can send it to your, your commander. That was part of the plan. We're going to get a list from each zone to find out which, try to prioritize which vehicles need removed sooner rather than later, I should say. And we're going to, we're planning on taking that approach. Okay, great, And I had again. you know, you hear things and I, you know just is: do we have, is there still, or was there an issue with where to where to put the vehicles when, once they're removed? I thought maybe there might be an issue with storage space. No, that's so. the vehicles are removed, they're abandoned or they're taken by a salver- We have there's a couple, I think each zone has their own- and then they take them to their own storage facility. Okay, All right. Well, that sounds good. Thank you very much. That's a. that's good news. I'm glad to hear it. Thank you, You're welcome. Thank you, Any further discussion? Second round, councilman, what's your name? Coghill? Yes, So first of all, I love the idea about the blitz. Yeah, me too. I feel like we're back on the football field and I and I, Marty and I, go way back. We're old friends and I agree with councilman McKayle Smith as to the morale of the department, And I'm not just saying it, cause I'm biased. Honestly, Marty, you know I've known you for a long time and I know you know how to treat people, You're fair and you're honest and no, I appreciate the progress that you've made in the short time that you've made it. Well, that's just a, just a rank and file. It's just really, really great not to be my phone not ringing off the hook because complaints about our acting chief, So it's good. I love the blitz. you know ripples really good at removing vehicles, I guess. Yeah, So the, the V or the, the traffic unit was moved back to him effectively. Oh, so we'll be able to take care of that We had. that includes the motorcycles. Is there a skip? second round? That's includes the motorcycles. Is that right? Is that part of that? Yeah, The entire truck. Yeah, I still have to say you know the horses are coming out on Memorial day for me to last their last. I think we'll work on that as city employees. I should say their last parade. But so, okay, that's it for me, Thank you. Thanks, Councilwoman kale Smith, I'm going to bring the horses up for the next bill, Okay, But for this one I just want to say I love the idea of the blitz and, and I, an art area. the fifth division has a lot of boats, you know, and that they they were storing the boats from across the city There and it was caught starting to cause a landslide. Right, There's an issue with the storage of the boats. Yeah, So I just I want us to be mindful of where, like what we're doing and where we're putting them, And I want us to start in order of districts, not nine backwards. but you know it'd be nice. They started one, two, three. We'll get it figured out, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, But let's do alphabetical order. Yeah, Yeah, When I'm gone, they'll start everything with district two first. Any further discussion? I just had one question. This is a question that was one of those ideas that come up from constituents and now's the time to ask it, I think, because I hadn't gotten a chance to before Now. it was an idea that, acknowledging that some makes and models are more susceptible to break-ins than others, to figure out a way to somehow- I don't know if we even have record of that- or working with Penn dot to alert those drivers to their susceptibility of break-ins because of the, the, the maker, the model of their car. Would we ever do anything Like that or more general PSA. I believe we did. Okay, I believe when Chief Scarada was here, we put out a public safety announcement. There's two types of vehicles that are more susceptible to being stolen: Others there, Hyundai in the Kia Right, And I know that we had talked and I believe it moved forward. on providing clubs. Yeah, The old club You're staring at. Yes, Older people remember the clubs hand a nose out, And I believe that happened under Chief Scarada and there was just talk about doing that again recently. Okay, great, I'll pass this along to the residents And then I can have the PIOs put out another public safety. Great, We'll look, we'll look out for that. Okay, And we never worked with the like the, the scrap yards or the owners of the folks who take that to sort of I don't know. Is there any way, is there any work that we do with them directly to be on the lookout for that particular type of? most of the vehicles that are being stolen now nowadays are stolen by juveniles for joy, for joy, riding, Yeah, And as far as like a I think you're referring to, maybe like a chop shop or a car, was stolen. since I've been here almost 26 years, I've never. it's not where they're right. It doesn't occur much or at all in the city of Pittsburgh, So we're fortunate as far as that. Okay, Thank you very much. Any further discussion seeing none. All those in favor of bill 1821 please indicate by saying aye, Aye, Affirmative recommendation.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

I believe we have one officer and I just wanted- I know there's some issues with storage and whatnot- We just we do get a lot of calls about abandoned vehicles and I understand that it takes that. it's sort of a complicated process and if there's any, if you have any thoughts about what you know, what's going on, what can be done to kind of make this a faster process or what the what, the what sort of the pain points are around getting, you know, getting vehicles abandoned, vehicles towed, And I know too, I've also had situations with, like boats, you know larger vehicles, boats, trailers, that type of thing. So boats are a little bit of a trickier issue. However, to answer your question regarding the abandoned vehicles, in the very near future I have a plan to to have a abandoned vehicle blitz where we're going to hit each zone and try to clean up as many abandoned vehicles as possible. Oh, that's great. Can we? can we send you, because you know I have a lot? we have a long list between myself getting calls and also the office. you know we have a whole long list. Should we send that to you or should we send it to our commander? You can send it to your, your commander. That was part of the plan. We're going to get a list from each zone to find out which, try to prioritize which vehicles need removed sooner rather than later, I should say. And we're going to, we're planning on taking that approach. Okay, great, And I had again. you know, you hear things and I, you know just is: do we have, is there still, or was there an issue with where to where to put the vehicles when, once they're removed? I thought maybe there might be an issue with storage space. No, that's so. the vehicles are removed, they're abandoned or they're taken by a salver- We have there's a couple, I think each zone has their own- and then they take them to their own storage facility. Okay, All right. Well, that sounds good. Thank you very much. That's a. that's good news. I'm glad to hear it. Thank you, You're welcome. Thank you, Any further discussion? Second round, councilman, what's your name? Coghill? Yes, So first of all, I love the idea about the blitz. Yeah, me too. I feel like we're back on the football field and I and I, Marty and I, go way back. We're old friends and I agree with councilman McKayle Smith as to the morale of the department, And I'm not just saying it, cause I'm biased. Honestly, Marty, you know I've known you for a long time and I know you know how to treat people, You're fair and you're honest and no, I appreciate the progress that you've made in the short time that you've made it. Well, that's just a, just a rank and file. It's just really, really great not to be my phone not ringing off the hook because complaints about our acting chief, So it's good. I love the blitz. you know ripples really good at removing vehicles, I guess. Yeah, So the, the V or the, the traffic unit was moved back to him effectively. Oh, so we'll be able to take care of that We had. that includes the motorcycles. Is there a skip? second round? That's includes the motorcycles. Is that right? Is that part of that? Yeah, The entire truck. Yeah, I still have to say you know the horses are coming out on Memorial day for me to last their last. I think we'll work on that as city employees. I should say their last parade. But so, okay, that's it for me, Thank you. Thanks, Councilwoman kale Smith, I'm going to bring the horses up for the next bill, Okay, But for this one I just want to say I love the idea of the blitz and, and I, an art area. the fifth division has a lot of boats, you know, and that they they were storing the boats from across the city There and it was caught starting to cause a landslide. Right, There's an issue with the storage of the boats. Yeah, So I just I want us to be mindful of where, like what we're doing and where we're putting them, And I want us to start in order of districts, not nine backwards. but you know it'd be nice. They started one, two, three. We'll get it figured out, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, But let's do alphabetical order. Yeah, Yeah, When I'm gone, they'll start everything with district two first. Any further discussion? I just had one question. This is a question that was one of those ideas that come up from constituents and now's the time to ask it, I think, because I hadn't gotten a chance to before Now. it was an idea that, acknowledging that some makes and models are more susceptible to break-ins than others, to figure out a way to somehow- I don't know if we even have record of that- or working with Penn dot to alert those drivers to their susceptibility of break-ins because of the, the, the maker, the model of their car. Would we ever do anything Like that or more general PSA. I believe we did. Okay, I believe when Chief Scarada was here, we put out a public safety announcement. There's two types of vehicles that are more susceptible to being stolen: Others there, Hyundai in the Kia Right, And I know that we had talked and I believe it moved forward. on providing clubs. Yeah, The old club You're staring at. Yes, Older people remember the clubs hand a nose out, And I believe that happened under Chief Scarada and there was just talk about doing that again recently. Okay, great, I'll pass this along to the residents And then I can have the PIOs put out another public safety. Great, We'll look, we'll look out for that. Okay, And we never worked with the like the, the scrap yards or the owners of the folks who take that to sort of I don't know. Is there any way, is there any work that we do with them directly to be on the lookout for that particular type of? most of the vehicles that are being stolen now nowadays are stolen by juveniles for joy, for joy, riding, Yeah, And as far as like a I think you're referring to, maybe like a chop shop or a car, was stolen. since I've been here almost 26 years, I've never. it's not where they're right. It doesn't occur much or at all in the city of Pittsburgh, So we're fortunate as far as that. Okay, Thank you very much. Any further discussion seeing none. All those in favor of bill 1821 please indicate by saying aye, Aye, Affirmative recommendation.","Pittsburgh City Council approves $583,100 grant to fund police auto theft squad detectives and equipment.","**Pittsburgh City Council approves $583,100 grant to fund police auto theft squad detectives and equipment**

• Pittsburgh City Council approved a resolution allowing the city to receive up to $583,100 from the Pennsylvania Auto Theft Prevention Agency to support the police Auto Squad

• The grant money, funded by insurance companies, will pay for detective salaries, overtime, equipment, and vehicles for the auto theft unit

• Council members questioned police leadership about past problems with the grant program, including money sitting unused and staffing issues that led to a detective leaving the department

• Acting Police Chief Morgan Devine said the department now has two detectives working in the auto theft unit after previously being down to just one officer

• The grant requires the city to follow regular spending rules and deposit the money into a specific grants account

• Police officials said most car thefts in Pittsburgh are committed by young people taking cars for joyrides, not organized crime groups running chop shops

• The department previously issued public warnings about Hyundai and Kia vehicles being easier targets for theft and provided steering wheel locks to help prevent break-ins

Yeah, The electronic detection dog is used mostly by the FBI, for Somebody throws a phone, commits a crime, throws a phone or something You know, for lack of better term, it's for child porn.

A motion to approve. brief discussion. Second, Again: canines, but different company. Is that right? Yes, sir, The Vanderhouse Gill Company is in Ohio, practically almost in Indiana. The Browner Group is in West Virginia. It's about a two and a half hour drive. We just have them so that we have competing and we have different options for the dogs in case one doesn't have any dogs that are appropriate for us. We can go and try. the other breeder Got it. Yeah, that's it for me. That's good. That's what I figured Just briefly. I was just going to say that we're going to, so we're purchasing possible six dogs over three years. Is that right? No, Again, we will only. we typically only purchase maybe one or maybe one or two a year. It all depends on the age and the suitability of the canines that we have working. As they age out, we replace them. We don't add any more people to the unit. Right now we have two that are available that we're hoping to put on in the fall. but other than that, it's Purchase them as you need. But this is putting the funds there so we can Right. Okay, Thank you, Councilman Kale-Spence. There was an RFP for both of these, correct? Yeah, there's an RFP and I have it in front of me if you want to review it. Yeah, Lisa, Thank you. Thank you, Council President LaFell. Just a quick question, Thank you. I'd actually never heard of an electronic sniffing dog, so I looked it up and it's actually pretty fascinating what they can do. but it also talks about the handler getting special training as well. I'm just curious: do we have enough handlers? Do we have enough handlers? I'll always take more. That's the short answer. Right now we have two spaces available, One for a narcotics dog and another one for another explosives dog. so we're hoping to fill those positions in the fall. but again, it comes down to whether we can afford people from the zones, if we can add these positions, whether we can get the funding for the dogs, which. thank you very much. It looks like we're gonna have funding for them, but you know I'll always take more. Okay, Any further discussion Seeing none all those in favor of Bill 1823, please indicate by saying aye, Aye.

A motion to approve. brief discussion. Second, Again: canines, but different company. Is that right? Yes, sir, The Vanderhouse Gill Company is in Ohio, practically almost in Indiana. The Browner Group is in West Virginia. It's about a two and a half hour drive. We just have them so that we have competing and we have different options for the dogs in case one doesn't have any dogs that are appropriate for us. We can go and try. the other breeder Got it. Yeah, that's it for me. That's good. That's what I figured Just briefly. I was just going to say that we're going to, so we're purchasing possible six dogs over three years. Is that right? No, Again, we will only. we typically only purchase maybe one or maybe one or two a year. It all depends on the age and the suitability of the canines that we have working. As they age out, we replace them. We don't add any more people to the unit. Right now we have two that are available that we're hoping to put on in the fall. but other than that, it's Purchase them as you need. But this is putting the funds there so we can Right. Okay, Thank you, Councilman Kale-Spence. There was an RFP for both of these, correct? Yeah, there's an RFP and I have it in front of me if you want to review it. Yeah, Lisa, Thank you. Thank you, Council President LaFell. Just a quick question, Thank you. I'd actually never heard of an electronic sniffing dog, so I looked it up and it's actually pretty fascinating what they can do. but it also talks about the handler getting special training as well. I'm just curious: do we have enough handlers? Do we have enough handlers? I'll always take more. That's the short answer. Right now we have two spaces available, One for a narcotics dog and another one for another explosives dog. so we're hoping to fill those positions in the fall. but again, it comes down to whether we can afford people from the zones, if we can add these positions, whether we can get the funding for the dogs, which. thank you very much. It looks like we're gonna have funding for them, but you know I'll always take more. Okay, Any further discussion Seeing none all those in favor of Bill 1823, please indicate by saying aye, Aye. Affirmative recommendation. Thank you all very much, Thank you. Thank you all for your work. Be safe, Thank you.","Pittsburgh City Council approves $30,000 contract with West Virginia company to buy police dogs over three years.","**Pittsburgh City Council approves $30,000 contract with West Virginia company to buy police dogs over three years**
