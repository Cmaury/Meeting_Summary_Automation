Motion to approve: Second With discussion. councilman, Yeah, thank you. I appreciate you reading the will of council. as the various bodies of government, we need to come together and work together and really, you know this is not the time to say, oh well, PRT is not my problem, or oh well, that's right, like this is not a PRT problem, this is not a county problem, or you know, this is a problem for all of us across the region. And so you know, whether it's the SPC, the business community, city council, the mayor's office, county exec, et cetera, you know, county council, et cetera, and our state partners, we really need to come together to ensure, not just to be honest, that we have this emergency funding right to keep our transit from being cut, but that we have strong, dedicated transit funding going forward. Transit and housing are inextricably linked and we already have, you know. you know, as folks are not able to work or to afford to live in the city of Pittsburgh, they are moving outside to the boroughs and transit, and it makes it incredibly hard for people to get in to jobs in the city of Pittsburgh without a car. So, you know, as we're working on growing our affordable housing, we also need to be working on not just saving but improving our transit service, because it is a lifeline to jobs, healthcare, school, et cetera for our most vulnerable residents. But even even more than that, and this is what I would really underscore to you know, perhaps our Republican colleagues in other counties, you know, around Allegheny County, et cetera, transit is an economic driver In this day and age a city like Pittsburgh is. you know, if we are going to grow economically, we need to be attracting people from you know, places like the Silicon Valley, Chicago, the tri-state area, right, And people who live in those places and companies that are operating in those places that may have an eye on Pittsburgh. the fact that you that it's very difficult to get around not just the county but even the city, right, Even just in the heart of our city, it can be very difficult to get around without a car, right, You need a car to go a mile and a half and that is not attractive to people who want to move to. to me, that is sort of the you know as someone who lives in a safe neighborhood with a good school and all the great stuff I love where I live in Pittsburgh. but the transit is an issue. right, I'm lucky I have a car. but if I were looking at places, if I were used to public transit, if I were used to living in a city that had, you know, outstanding transit, it would be an issue, It would be something that would sort of raise an eyebrow if I were looking at Pittsburgh, and I think that will be the same for employers and, you know, companies that are looking to move here. So, yeah, thanks to all my colleagues for signing on to this. and you know, I know, in June Pittsburghers for Public Transit is organizing- I don't know when exactly, but some kind of rally day to go to Harrisburg. You know, I hope that you know, together with Philly, with folks in Philly. so I hope that we can. all I know, on May 5th the SPC is going to be in Harrisburg. I'm going to head to, you know, head down there for the day with them. to you know, try and have some meetings around this, but really really underscore in every way we can across the aisle that not only do we need to save transit in Allegheny County, we really need to start investing in it in a meaningful way, because great cities have great transit. so thanks, Thank you. Any further comments? Councilman Mosley? Yeah, first I want to thank Councilwoman Warwick, my apologies. I'd like to thank Councilman Strasburger for meeting with me today. I know I've said so many things, but today I want to thank Councilwoman Warwick for her leadership on this will of council. You know I've always been a huge proponent of public transit. It's Council President Lavelle who we've known each other for many, many years. He used to be my ride when we were much younger, in our 20s, hanging out when we worked on this floor for a councilman Dean. he always made fun of me for not having my driver's license. We were in our early 20s and so I know the the public transit system. you know on a personal level and know the importance of having a robust public transit system, particularly at this time as this council is deliberating zoning codes and planning initiatives that require a level of density that also requires a robust public transit system, But we're going to have the kind of density and growth that we're looking at as we embark on a historic, comprehensive plan. So this is not the time to be pulling back from transit, but actually to be doubling down and investing in transit, you know, and not only just in the service that we have, but expanding rapid transit, whether it's bus rapid transit or, in my perfect world, expanding our light rail infrastructure to different parts of the county, as well as beginning to think about the conversation that Senator Costa started over the weekend about looking at expanding our transit system to a regional transit system. So I think we're going to have to start with the transit system and not having this hodgepodge of several eight different county authorities, you know, that work together very inefficiently, with a lot of duplication, You know. so now is the time, you know, for us to be doubling down on transit and, as we go and look at what Pittsburgh's going to be in 2050, I would hope that it's a Pittsburgh that has a robust transit system and, like my colleague, Councilwoman Warwick said, there's not a great, you know, city in the world that doesn't have a great public transit system, and I want Pittsburgh to be among the group of cities known to be some of the greatest cities in the world. So I think it's incumbent upon us, whether we are county officials or state officials or municipal officials or advocates- And I believe this afternoon at 1: 30 there is a rally downtown at Pitt Avenue, headed by the transit advocates. I know there's going to be- some of us will be there, some other elected officials, as well as the public comment period, and we'll stay open until June, if you go to rodprtorg. So thank you, Councilwoman Warwick, Thank you to all the members for supporting this, and I look forward to going to Harrisburg and all other forms of advocacy so that we can save transit as it is but then begin to build a much better transit system in the future. Thank you very much. Thank you, Councilwoman Warwick, for bringing this forward. I'll simply add this is not a problem that was not unknown. The governor, to Councilman Mosley's point, helped out SEPTA, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority. thank you, helped them out a year ago with the funding they needed to make sure that they were able to be sustainable going into the future, And so now we need the governor to indeed do the same in this case. So thank you for bringing this forward. All those in favor say aye, Aye. Any opposed? The will of council has been approved.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

Any further comments? Councilman Mosley? Yeah, first I want to thank Councilwoman Warwick, my apologies. I'd like to thank Councilman Strasburger for meeting with me today. I know I've said so many things, but today I want to thank Councilwoman Warwick for her leadership on this will of council. You know I've always been a huge proponent of public transit. It's Council President Lavelle who we've known each other for many, many years. He used to be my ride when we were much younger, in our 20s, hanging out when we worked on this floor for a councilman Dean. he always made fun of me for not having my driver's license. We were in our early 20s and so I know the the public transit system. you know on a personal level and know the importance of having a robust public transit system, particularly at this time as this council is deliberating zoning codes and planning initiatives that require a level of density that also requires a robust public transit system, But we're going to have the kind of density and growth that we're looking at as we embark on a historic, comprehensive plan. So this is not the time to be pulling back from transit, but actually to be doubling down and investing in transit, you know, and not only just in the service that we have, but expanding rapid transit, whether it's bus rapid transit or, in my perfect world, expanding our light rail infrastructure to different parts of the county, as well as beginning to think about the conversation that Senator Costa started over the weekend about looking at expanding our transit system to a regional transit system. So I think we're going to have to start with the transit system and not having this hodgepodge of several eight different county authorities, you know, that work together very inefficiently, with a lot of duplication, You know. so now is the time, you know, for us to be doubling down on transit and, as we go and look at what Pittsburgh's going to be in 2050, I would hope that it's a Pittsburgh that has a robust transit system and, like my colleague, Councilwoman Warwick said, there's not a great, you know, city in the world that doesn't have a great public transit system, and I want Pittsburgh to be among the group of cities known to be some of the greatest cities in the world. So I think it's incumbent upon us, whether we are county officials or state officials or municipal officials or advocates- And I believe this afternoon at 1: 30 there is a rally downtown at Pitt Avenue, headed by the transit advocates. I know there's going to be- some of us will be there, some other elected officials, as well as the public comment period, and we'll stay open until June, if you go to rodprtorg. So thank you, Councilwoman Warwick, Thank you to all the members for supporting this, and I look forward to going to Harrisburg and all other forms of advocacy so that we can save transit as it is but then begin to build a much better transit system in the future. Thank you very much. Thank you, Councilwoman Warwick, for bringing this forward. I'll simply add this is not a problem that was not unknown. The governor, to Councilman Mosley's point, helped out SEPTA, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority. thank you, helped them out a year ago with the funding they needed to make sure that they were able to be sustainable going into the future, And so now we need the governor to indeed do the same in this case. So thank you for bringing this forward. All those in favor say aye, Aye. Any opposed? The will of council has been approved.",Pittsburgh City Council urges state to give $117 million to Pittsburgh Regional Transit to prevent 35% service cuts and route eliminations.,"• Pittsburgh City Council passed a resolution asking Pennsylvania's state government and Governor Josh Shapiro to give Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) $117 million in 2026 to prevent major service cuts

• Without this funding, PRT plans to cut bus service by 35% and raise fares by 9%, which council members called ""catastrophic""

• The cuts would eliminate 41 bus routes completely, reduce service on 54 other routes, and end all bus service after 11 p.m.

• Disabled riders would face even deeper cuts, with paratransit service reduced by 62% and fares increased by 20%

• Council members said the cuts would hurt tens of thousands of people who rely on buses to get to work, school, medical appointments, and grocery stores

• PRT serves 120,000 daily riders, contributes $1 billion to the state economy, and keeps 39,000 cars off the road

• One in four Pittsburgh households don't have access to a car and depend on public transit

• Council members pointed out that Governor Shapiro gave $153 million to SEPTA (Philadelphia's transit system) in 2024 to prevent similar cuts

• The resolution will be sent to state lawmakers and the governor's office

• Council members said good transit is essential for economic growth and attracting new residents and businesses to Pittsburgh

• All council members supported the resolution, which was sponsored by Councilwoman Warwick"

Our first registered speaker is Stormy Morris. Hi, City Council, Stormy Morris. I live in McKeesport now. When I was younger, I used to be a member of the Homewood Youth Group and our leader was Jerry Murray And he used to take us around to talent shows and television shows and just help us, help the community in the best way that we could. We used to volunteer and things like that. So one day we had to go to Channel 11 to tape a show And before we taped the show somebody pulled Jerry Murray aside and said: yeah, we heard that you're going to have your kids down at the convention center to perform And Mr Murray said, yeah, I am. And he said: well, we really don't think that they can represent the black community too well, So we don't want them to come down there. And Mr Murray was upset about it, but there was really nothing he could do about it. So we did perform at Channel 11, But what we didn't know was Lorne Mann was standing outside of the door waiting for his turn to tape his segment. And he made a phone call The next day. Mr Murray came up to us in a meeting and he said: by the way, we are invited to dance at the convention center. And we all were happy, of course. And what I learned from Lorne Mann is: when you want to change the world, little things, just little things at a time- get involved. He didn't know us, He didn't care about us, But he heard the situation and he got involved. And last night I was at the mayor debate at the Kingsley Center and there was a lot of people talking about young people in Pittsburgh that need help, And I help young people too, but because I work a lot, I can't get involved as much as I would like to. So right now I would like to present a 5,000 money order to Pittsburgh City Council And I'm asking you to help the young people because I know, you know where everything is and who needs help. So, whether it's a girl that needs a prom dress, a kid that needs a pair of shoes, maybe a student at CMU is short on lunch money, something, So just take this and help the young people, Thank you. Thank you very much. Our next speaker is Dr Ronald N Miller. Dr Ronald N Miller, downtown Helsinki, Finland. In the early 2000s, I became a member of the American Physical Society, the American Philosophical Association and the American Academy of Religion, And I'm also the author of Global Intelligence 2010 to 2025, the Global Intelligence Society. Candidate for President 2028: globalinformationintelligencenetworknet Council. concerns include the local vote and local housing. This is consistent with two initiatives of mine for 2028: one vote by voter verification for whom to approach the Supreme Court, And also I'm a member of the National Council of the United States and I'm part of the National Security Council's local government advocacy committee. Since I was a little boy, I've been a member of the National Security Council And I'm a member of the National Security Council and I'm also a member of the local government primacy. Last week, on 22 April 2025, a disabled veteran said to me, sat down beside me and said to me: I've been listening to you on Public City Channel and you make some good points, But he didn't tell me what a good point is. What is a good point? So what I'm going to do is to specify using three and a triad that I use in global intelligence of physics, philosophy and religious studies. In physical studies, physics a good is a solution to a problem. A point is that other solutions are reduced to zero value. The approach that is taken in philosophical studies is that good. basically, baseline here is a syllogistic argument in which there's a proposition A and it's added to a proposition B to get to conclusion C And the essential point is that there are other options which are excluded. So it reduces the alternatives, the plausible alternatives, to zero. In religious studies, if I can focus for a moment on Hinayana Buddhism, the good is the decrease of suffering and the point is the zero self or the no self. Move, move, let him speak. I can't hear him. Please go, let him speak. I can't hear him. There's a little interruption here. So what I want, what I think, is that these show that we need to get to a zero in order to have a constructive one. in housing, That means one individual in one house, very small, lowest cost, one to 1,000, and do it within a month. Thank you very much. Our next speaker is Zosia Minifield. Do not see Zosia online. Is Zosia Minifield with us? If not, our next speaker is Ayas Azuni. I'm also not see online. Therefore, our next speaker is Nicole Schaefer. Hi, good morning council members. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. My name is Nicole Schaefer, 1437 Browning Road in Highland Park. I come to you today when I was a student. I was a student a interjected speaker on all funerals at a lot of officemomentaminers, but I wanted to believe that I was useful and that's not a bad thing for me. I had a greatoy part of an ever dwindling club of city assets that are beloved and well used for programming that reflects the needs of our communities, while scraping by to make spectacular results on shoestring budgets. in the past, this scrappy approach has worked, but today i must tell you, kingsley is at a crossroads. despite rising costs, skyrocketing utilities, staffing needs and the massive expense of operating an indoor pool- which those of you that have a hot tub or a pool know that the amount of money that you spend on those are- it's a sinking ship- kingsley has received far too little public or private investment compared to the essential services it provides. it does not receive rad funding like other public assets in our city. it doesn't receive any substantial funds from silver sneakers or the wellness programming it provides at low or no cost to upmc and highmark subscribers, mainly our seniors. it gets pennies on the reimbursements from public assistance and yet it's a proud and humble organization that opens its stores to all, without question. it's easy to assume that community centers should be free, yet nothing about maintaining a beautiful, open and joyful facility, paying living wages to lifeguards and educators and non-profit employees, and keeping the lights on and water warm for a family swim night. none of that's free. running a facility like the kingsley requires the same care and resources that we invest in infrastructure like roads and waterways, bridges, our public transportation and water systems, because community infrastructure is every bit as essential to health, wellness and by resilience of our city. while the corporate landscape continues to expand, offering services accessible to only those who can pay, kingsley stands as one of the few places where the doors are open to everyone, offering tangible benefits: swim lessons, youth workforce training, senior fitness classes and technology for underserved communities. and yet it provides intangible benefits that are harder to quantify, but in a way that makes it possible for us to live without. it's a technology that is unique and truly important to people all across the country. it's a technology that is not even possible to live without. it fights isolation. it builds civic connection across race, class and generation. it creates spaces for joyful engagement, leadership, development and public trust. in the coming weeks you're going to hear from a variety of voices that will share with you the imperfect storm that's created a situation that the scrappiest creatives can't innovate in front of. if we fail to act now, in the next 120 days, the city and county do not step forward with critical support. we risk ask you as a citizen, thank you very much. the urban infrastructure and the access it includes for the invisible and fast thank you. you can also always submit your comments to the clerk's office so we can get them in full. that exhausts our list of registered speakers. if there's anyone in chambers wishing to speak, please come forward at the time, provide your name and neighborhood for the record. you also give three minutes to speak. i am burning to meet you. thank you, mayor gainey, for realizing the mental health help needs for the homeless, the addiction issues with the homeless population. it's because they do not have the mental health help and medical help so they self-medicate to numb. i'm an old-school medical transcriptionist. that was before the legal secretary and the paralegal hats of many, before the age of electronics. we, we old ladies, had to transcribe those doctors notes. i still do shorthand. bernie, come take a note. mr so-and-so is self-medicating with pain and alcohol for his pain with alcohol and street drugs. note to selves when you're sleeping on the ground you're going to self-medicate. bernie, take a note. miss hoosie watson never had mental health treatment as a child and has learned not safe behavior and is self-medicating with alcohol and street drugs to dull the low self-esteem at mercy. when an addict was admitted it was not unusual for a doctor to order beer for a patient. why the sudden stop of the drugs and alcohol will kill a patient on the streets begging for money. they are begging not to die. corey is pushing click catch phrases. we need transparency. click phrases for the soapbox speech like the old paradigm social construct woke now the word transparency and the law of the law is a law of the law. we need transparency. corey must be watching a whole bunch of love and love and marriage in huntsville because they use the word transfer. parents see all the time, but here's the reality- to transparency. you can't say you're going to get us transparency in government when we have sunshine laws and the right to know laws. the sunshine blog made windows to government. we already have transparency. you can't promise to give us what we already have. mayor ganey, thank you. behavior, health teams for the homeless and the health and wellness groups are going to be the best place to be and we're going to be the best place to be and we're going to be the best place to be. and i would strongly suggest start hiring social worker grads and train them to be police officers. imagine the possibilities. create incentives that the current officers can get online degree programs. we have all these universities up the street that don't pay taxes, educate, are already in place and are going forward. our police officers, the whole entire public safety staff- get them credentialed. make these non-paying entities. do something for the city that will actually help us, thank you. thank you very much, next speaker, please. good morning, my name is yvonne f brown. i brought my sign again. i'd just like to say thank god that we're holding all this up. this has been 1 million. we've also wonangan's bidding, so this has been 1. 5 million. we have been holding a maximum of 6 Thursday drink and movie jack, the human rights justice Discordable 5 in every bank. you can round up 15 plus 3. total to 9 money promised to 50 percent of 2019. we've still got a handling to Q. measures are being made. staying inside, because now the open breaking down that table I have over here i could take a lot of leave. this is at business. my social security and I am going to join the membership again. I have been a little lax, the same as you have been, but the NAACP fought for us. They have brought out things that we did not know about. I have to stop for a minute because, Mr Warwick, I need to speak directly to you for you to understand what I am saying. When someone is standing up here speaking citizens who have taken their time to come down, where, as you are still sitting home and calling the phone and make your announcement, We come here, you come and you stand behind and he is talking and you are running and talking. You are supposed to wait until we get finished. We have three minutes, that's all, And you know what I have made up my mind. I was going to come down. I was coming down with a good spirit. a good spirit. I was going to come down and say you know what? I am going to hear it, But you are really trying me, because the law says we have three minutes and you cannot keep your behind up here at the table or up here without coming back here While we are talking. you are in somebody's ear, Do you understand? Do you understand We have three minutes and we have a lot to say. I know I do. I have been coming here for 20 something years and the disrespect I received from you staff, even you, Mr, your wife- I know your wife- I mean, I tell you I'm gonna just stop because I am sick and tired of the disrespect. You should be charged 5 any time you get up from that table. So if five years of, not a year's ain't fair, we got 45, we can get, and maybe we can use for ourselves, Maybe we can take it. hold the table, We can have the table. You know, I'm just so confused because I don't understand how you became council people and don't realize that we are supposed to be given honor and respect. The honor is to shut your mouth while we're talking three minutes. You just do hours, hours. We have to sit here hours and just run your mouth during the three little minutes. Do you understand? 60 seconds times three? That's all we got And you just got it. You got hours and you run your mouth repeating the same stuff over. Oh, I like the way you said that, Mr So-and-so. Please give us some respect. Thank you very much, Ms Brown. Tired of this? Next speaker, please. Next speaker, please. Seeing no further speakers, we'll turn to the presentation of papers, beginning with Councilman Charland, chair of human resources. Newly papers, Mr President, Thank you. Councilman Coghill, chair of public safety and wellness, Newly papers. Mr President, Councilman Coghill has no new papers.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

• Stormy Morris, who lives in McKeesport, gave Pittsburgh City Council a $5,000 money order to help young people in the city

• Morris asked council members to use the money for basic needs like prom dresses, shoes, or lunch money for college students

• She said she works too much to get involved in helping youth as much as she'd like, so she wants the council to distribute the money since they know where help is needed

• Morris shared a story from her youth about community leader Jerry Murray and TV personality Lorne Mann, saying she learned that ""when you want to change the world, little things, just little things at a time - get involved""

• The donation came after Morris attended a mayoral debate where candidates talked about young people in Pittsburgh needing help

• Council accepted the donation during the public comment portion of their meeting"
