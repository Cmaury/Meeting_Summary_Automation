I would like to remind all speakers that the rules of council state that comments are limited to matters of concern, official action or deliberation which are or may be before city council. profanity will not be permitted. Please state your name and neighborhood for the record. You will have three minutes to speak And our first and only registered speaker is Edward Wren. Hi, can you hear me? We can hear you. Okay, great. So I apologize for having missed giving testimony before full council yesterday. My name is Edward, The Swiss Elm Park neighborhood of Pittsburgh, represented by council member Barb Warwick. She is the primary sponsor of the bill to amend city code to allow exceptions for vegetation other than trees and shrubs being no greater than 10 inches in height. I testify in favor of passing the bill on May 13th or postponing a vote in order to propose a new bill. Thank you, I will ask the council to prepare a more comprehensive approach to environmentally favorable land care in the near future. I will provide expanded written testimony to supplement my remarks. I appreciate the assistance that the Audubon society at Western PA has given in formulating the bill. However, I would also like for this council to consider input from other organizations. I'm a co founder of the Western PA area chapter of the national organization. While once plants natural landscapes, We have a suggested native planting ordinance created by one of our- volunteer- quote wild- lawyers. unquote. The Pennsylvania Native Plant Society has an extensive list of native plant ordinances in PA and elsewhere. Phipps Conservatory would be an excellent resource. Pasa Sustainable Agriculture would be a good resource about incorporating edible plants into landscaping code. Strategically, I would like for the city to center land care policy on the realization that grass lawns, including those with little or no foot traffic, have little environmental benefits but may cause various serious harms, as I will elaborate on in my written testimony. I would like for the city to keep this in mind in their own operations. For example, the city often uses loud and extraordinarily polluting gasoline and other natural gas products to protect its natural environment. The city has been working hard to keep the plant from being polluted by polluting power equipment, even though electric equipment has become increasingly affordable and effective. On the other hand, native plants are essential to biodiversity in our ecosystems and can address many expensive and disrupting problems, including flooding, landslides and urban heat island effects. They are beautiful and fascinating. Many people employed in lawn maintenance and other fields could be trained for more satisfying, more efficient and more efficient work in natural land care with less exposure to toxic chemicals. Thanks for your attention. Thanks very much. There being no further registered speakers, we will now take comments from those in the audience wishing to speak. Are there any speakers wishing to come to the podium? My name is Yvonne F Brown. I live at 75th Street and I live in the San Francisco area. I live in the San Francisco area for about a year and I'm a resident of San Francisco. I'm a resident of San Francisco and I'm a resident of San Francisco. I live at 715 Mercer Street, the top of the hill. Yesterday I came and I was trying to explain- well, I did explain that, walking down Carson Street yesterday the other day and noticed a trail of pennies and as I followed the pennies they went up a whole bunch of money within the doorway. All this money, all this, it's about two dollars and something of nickels and dimes and this cup. So this probably was a homeless person's cup. Well, I was trying to explain. the homeless fellow stopped me and was saying: Miss Yvonne, there's an Asian cop on the south side that's beating up the homeless people. He said they were in the doorway and I think they were asleep. but anyway, he came and assaulted them. They took their computer, their laptop, Laptop and, I think, a tablet. Only thing I was thinking is this: if you put them out the hallway, okay, you did, but why take their computer? why take their laptop? That's the only thing they have. And the same way with this, this man probably took a while to collect this money. This was his cup and you can tell the homeless people. I'm sorry I didn't come months ago when they told me to tell city council, But if he would come I would give him his money back and he can have his cup. I'm worried about where is this person and what happened to him. I know he wouldn't have automatically just left this money, not if he begged all day or whatever. You just need to look at how the homeless people are being treated in this city And also the mayor. I have no respect for him. when they showed, the police looked like they were harming the homeless person and the mayor didn't take up for it. say something: Understand, they are still human beings. they just don't have a place to lay their head that they can call their own. I live in a place that I can call my own, but I'm being threatened. We are in a building where we got a woman that's beating the old people up. She beat a mother and daughter with a hammer. The woman- the mother did. She also took a stick and beat the man. He was heavier than me and he's small- And I said: what are you? why are you so small? You're going to die. He said I got cancer. My daughter said, mom, it's not your fault. My daughter said: mommy, don't go down there telling him nothing because it sounds like you're the troublemaker. No, I have to. My sister died with cancer, 45 years old, And, like she was explaining to me, she said: Yvonne, even my bones hurt. So this man was just standing talking to another resident where this woman that don't live in the building went down the hill, came back up with the stick and whacked him in his head And he was saying: why are you doing this? I'm coming down here because gents can do this. And I said: why don't gents do that? Because gents can do something about it. And when we cried, the police said: is Arbor and Petique that's dropping the bauble? OK, I need to tell you more, but please help us, Please. Deborah. distinctive voice. Thank you very much.

Today's subject- I'm so sorry- is Pittsburgh Regional Transit CEO Catherine Egan and her daughter Kelly Kellerman. hello, how are you? Proverbs 10. 16 says The wages of the righteous brings them life, but the income of the wicked brings them punishment. Let's talk about this punishment. Right now, PRT is facing a budget deficit of 100 million starting July 1st 2025. they're proposing to serve the. there's a significant service cut, fares increased to address the shortfall. A power line went down this month. I think it was a punishment from God, because here's the situation: The Technology Committee was approved for 348,000 for employee validation and testing services that they don't need right now. So what do you need this 348,000 for right now? You guys think you're going on vacation too. It's the same thing here. I, I, I approved, You're approving this money and you're not using it for what it's needed for. So God brought this power line down to show you that he has power, and now you don't. You're already in deficit- 100 million. It's crazy, and you want a 117 million increase in state funding to maintain current employment, Current service levels. Really, He's laughing at y'all. I'm so sorry. he's laughing Because I went in there to the budget to the committee meeting, the board meeting. I went to the committee meeting, got these numbers, went to the board meeting and asked them: when's the last time you did something for the homeless? Well, I'm homeless, Please help me. They directed me to their next meeting. That meeting was Friday. Their next meeting was Tuesday. She didn't even get me bus fare. That power line went down, Service was completely shut down. They had one train and service was behind over 30 minutes. In Jesus' name, Thank you. Imagine that.

Second Discussion. Council Member Warbick. I just I don't know if. what extra powers does this give? I'm just kind of curious. It's a fair question. I don't know the answer. I'd like to call anyone who can answer to the table. Take Mr Geiger. Good morning, David Geiger. Director of Legislation and Policy. I believe Deputy Mayor Pawlak may be joining for this discussion if needed. but, in short, the emergency declaration powers allow us to waive certain contracting provisions as well as move more quickly in ways that we normally can't. So I don't believe we've used the contracting powers, the expedited contracting powers, but one of the things that workers have been able to do is access private property quicker than they otherwise would have for downed trees, Things of that nature. So are we just so I'm clear when I talk to residents. so if someone has a, so obviously, if it's a street tree, we are. well, I guess I should, I'll like, I guess I should. well, I guess I should, I'll like. if it's a street tree, are we, you know, coming in and helping get it out of the way? you know, if it's a, if it's on a private like, if it's the trees on private property and falling on private property, are we intervene? just to understand for folks when we're talking to residents. the office of management budget, the emergency declaration, in broadly emergency declarations, are not required by the emergency declaration. the emergency declaration is a blanket waiver of competitive process when related to disaster response activities. however, in this case, the primary reason for the declaration of the emergency and the extension relates to the documentation of the emergency and the extension relates to the documentation of the emergency procurement process, documentation of disaster response activities for potential future financial support for either from the state or federal government. so the assessment is done by the office of emergency management and homeland security. they begin assessing damage and documenting it in the immediate aftermath of the storm. that analysis is ongoing. thus far they've primarily been assembling documentation and then, as the emergency response activity activities conclude, they'll begin analyzing that documentation for the purposes of submitting reports to FEMA and, potentially, FEMA. We don't yet know whether the costs associated with the storm response will qualify for aid, but the emergency declarations are an important prerequisite to being in that position. In terms of utilization of powers provided under an emergency declaration, the two examples that I can provide right now- I believe these are the only two instances where those have been used- is the waiver of fees for residents to drop off yard waste at our yard waste collection locations throughout the city as folks are cleaning up trees and other debris on their own property And limited. I don't know. I'm not sure if they're in the right place to say that. It's a little bit of a. I think a lot of the time. it's, you know, just a number of times. it's just a number of times where there's sort of a city worker activity on private property where a downed tree is both blocking the right-of-way or otherwise imperiling public safety or the storm response, but where the tree itself is a privately owned tree that we wouldn't normally engage with. So under normal circumstances, if a tree is in the middle of your front yard, it falls, responsibility for clearing that tree would be on the property owner. Under these circumstances, if that's the case and it is only affecting your property, we're still not, you know, having city workers engage in that work, although team rubicon, an outside non-profit agency that assists with disaster response, is available to do that work. but where a privately owned tree falls into the right of way or in in some other fashion is creating a health and safety risk, under the emergency declaration we're allowed to do some work on across that line. okay, that might be helpful. just about the trees, because i know a lot of people are just sort of like: yeah, you know, i have this giant tree and it's just, you know. i mean, i had a tree fall, not in this storm but previously, and it was a small train. i think i paid like something like two thousand dollars and it was a very small tree. so, yeah, i hope i didn't, councilman coggill, i hope i didn't. just just to emphasize, for for general awareness, all allegheny county residents, not just city of pittsburgh residents who are- have had trees fall or that type of damage on their property that is not being addressed by emergency responders because it's not imperiling the power lines or the right-of-way they should call, or can call 211 or go to pa211. org and they'll be connected with an operator. they, if they explain to them that that's the issue they're dealing with, that information will be sent to team rubicon who will then come out and do an assessment. okay, okay. and then the other question i had, because i- someone asked me about this and i wasn't sure have: has the state, has governor shapiro declared a state of emergency? no, and is that something that we are would like him to? would that be helpful to? i mean, i, you know, i know that there's just a handful of folks, but but people still don't have power. the pennsylvania emergency management agency, pima, has their own criteria for assessing when the state should declare an emergency. it's my understanding that those have not been met, that it's a decision whether or not to declare a state of emer. a commonwealth level state of emergency is a decision for for them and something that they undertake under their own criteria. so at this time, the local emergency declaration at the city level- and the county has also declared one- were deemed appropriate, based on our emergency response agencies, for the purposes of our own response, the, the state determination is is up to them. and i guess one last thing- and this is not something that i've asked, but i've had a few residents mention it is because it has been so long at this point- is: would it be possible for neighborhood services, or something like that, to go and actually do maybe some of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the door knocking in these like small sections where people have not had power now for gosh, eight days? yeah, just to- even if it's not something that we can like- do anything with getting the power on, just to kind of say: you know, yeah, we're here, is there anything just to make sure that everybody- i mean i think people, at least in my district, i think people do have what they need? but just to kind of be a hundred percent sure it's not something that neighborhood services specifically has done. there have been coordinated efforts of community-based and volunteer organizations doing some of that work. That's something I can certainly take back By way of an update- and this is Duquesne Light's update, not ours, but their latest estimates are that of individuals who lost power last Tuesday, As of last night, only 1,000 in their entire service area were still without power. So 1,000 folks for 1,000 folks. they did not meet the restoration time they had planned out for last night and those folks should be reactivated tomorrow- I'm sorry, by tonight. so they will have their power back on by tomorrow. There are, again, according to them, an additional 5,000 individuals who lost power at some point later in one of the subsequent rain events, again across their service area, who also have an estimated recovery time of 11: 30 pm tonight. So their projection is that they came 6,000 customers total short of their estimate, but that they expect every one of those to be addressed today. Okay, okay, And I don't actually know, like on Phillips Place and Beachwood. I have not checked in this morning yet so I don't know if they're on or not. Is it on? It will be tonight? It will be tonight, right, Okay? Yeah, everyone should be restored sometime today according to Duquesne Light's estimates. Got it, Got it, Okay. I think that's it for me. Thank you, Councilman Coghill, followed by Councilman Mosley. Thank you, Madam Chair. Morning David and Jake, How are you? Just a couple of clarification things while I was out there in the field, I guess you could say over a couple days there of the storm. We are not responsible for any tree from city property, whether it's a city paper street, whether it's city property, whether it's a park. If it falls on to somebody's home, we have no liability there, right? It's their homeowners or their car, or you know? is that accurate If it comes from a park, I believe. let me get you a firm answer. I believe those individuals could submit claims. Mm-hmm, The more cost. Yes, Yes, That's right. Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, It's a common issue. is a tree on private property falls, falls on the same property and does damage, or falls across a property line onto a neighbor's property, And those are all private disputes. Absolutely, That needs to be handled. But the insurance companies battle that out. that's not our problem. right, That's correct. But the reason I ask, I guess I don't know. Again, I'm just trying to be accurate, being out there. reason: I asked, I guess what? I don't know me again. I I'm just trying to be accurate, Being out there, I was just tell people because I know we are not responsible or don't take responsibility for cutting trees down that are on city paper streets, for instance, no matter if they're in- yeah, Joe, falling on to somebody's home. We don't do that as a service necessarily. we they're allowed to do it. we give them permission to do it or pay for it. The paper streets is the element of your question that I want to give misleading information on, because I don't, I don't know Off the top, my head got got OK. at the same time, if somebody's tree and some private property comes down on one of our dump trucks, across the hood of one of our dump trucks, do we file claim? then obviously, with that homeowners, We would. It depend on the circumstance. you know where there We. if a falling tree fell that caused damage to a city vehicle, we would probably pursue that through, you know, our self insurance and potentially there's. We don't do that for privately owned trees that fall in the right way of the sidewalk, even if that requires some repair work on our part So that they are that storm. I was at the fiori's pizza shop on West of the Avenue. I saw you know that. I know very well we call me. I'm a roofing contractors. report right, so I was there and not a job for me. I said first of all that, secondly, I worried, Or I was wondering like so. so they were working there that night. OK, makes on the place rebuilding the roof. lot of work, very lot of work there. I was shocked there, done probably. I'm not that they're not done, but they're. you know, I'm yeah, roof and dry, probably within 24 hours, 36 hours, somewhere, like that. just about yes, yeah, so it's what is it Situation? now I again I was worried like, oh my gosh, are going to call me about the I something's you know, and condemned it and I thought, oh my God, with, Everything seem to go smooth. nobody called me. so, yeah, because of the declaration of emergency, was he able to pursue it's that work with out? it's not. it's not letting itself. it's not related to a declaration of emergency, but it is related to provisions of the building code that relate to natural Disaster Disasters. you are permitted to begin repair work Caused by a natural disaster and have 3 days to file for the permits. so you, for you, have for 3 days, a 3 day grace period where you can be proceeding with work while simultaneously getting your permits. I wish I'd known it that, But I would have slept a lot easier. but I thought, oh my gosh, are going to call me in the morning saying we were alive, stuck a blue sticker on us, we're not at work, or the permits, and we were in contact At that time. communication and their rights to read your letter at. we did condemn the building for a time. oh, you have to because it was unsafe, right? this is an important clarification. condemnation does not mean The building is dead and it must be demolished. I think sometimes people hear the term condemnation. I think that what condemnation means is occupancy is prohibited except for I work to conduct repairs, right, and so that was the state the building was. and, as you said, I believe it was just just under the Building, right, And so that was the state the building was in. as you said, I believe it was just under the about 36 hours they were able to install a temporary roof. well, it's not temp. they were able to do enough work on the roof to then have occupancy restored for the first and second floor by i believe that was friday, yeah, it doesn't, and they reopened. well, i'm thankful that that was the process. i i wish again like i knew that that way i could have probably slept better that night, but i really didn't know and all i know is i was getting calls from other things and hoping that went smooth. so it did, and work there is ongoing for full restoration, but they're operational while that's happening, right, right. and then you know, i'll say this about duquesne light. emily was like a rock star for me. she picked up the phone, she they're taking a lot of heat today and you know, because, responding, there were people from alabama putting up lines in brookline. there were people from erie and cleveland and every municipality that you can drive to within 24 hours. probably. i don't know how far alabama is, but you know, maybe they flew in, i don't know, but they brought their own trucks today. yeah, right, yeah, they need to bring their equipment right. so it really was an unprecedented storm: lines down everywhere, twisted up. frustrating thing was we couldn't as public works. people were like: why can't they move the tree after? well, it has to be safe, right? i mean, the lines are down and, yes, without that clearance. so that was really the most frustrating thing, i would say. but i will say this: our public works crew kicked ass. they did, really did it. they're very true and if i, when they could, when they were allowed to, you know if i could just add to that. i also want to extend some gratitude to the bureau of fire. yes, fire fighters were attached to dpw crews and in some instances- not all- in some instances they were able to use their training to identify whether a line was hot or not and that allowed us to proceed with some tree work before duke and light was able to get to an area, which made the response quicker. to make a clear determination, they moved on and we did wait for duke and light, but that was an an important assist that we got from. that's a good point. i feel like our firefighters can do anything, even including helping out with the police department at some point, without talking about union lines or anything like that. but, yeah, you know, patrolling downtown, i'm telling you right now, our firefighters are are the best they really are. they're just good people, always looking to help, and very expertise in many, many fields, not just fighting fires. you know they were, they were essential as part of this response for sure, absolutely, absolutely, so okay, that's clarifies things for me. i i, if i can get clarification on the tree situation. i don't have that instance, by the way, which i'm glad, but it could have happened so easily. i mean, we can find out about the paper streets present, a unique example that i just don't want to be incorrect on, but we'll find that out and i get a lot of calls, people worried that a tree on our paper street are going to fall onto their home, not just during the storm, but you pretty much, yeah, year long. you know, understood, okay, thanks, appreciate it. thank you, councilman mosley. thank you, yeah, i just wanted to elaborate a little bit. you know, on some of the questions that have been raised specifically around. you know private trees on private property. you were saying that you know folks should reach out to 211. yeah, in that instance could you just talk a little bit? yeah, more detail for the public. so so, to reiterate, a public tree that has fallen on or done damage on private property, the city is not permitted or the county government agencies are not permitted to go to do that work. right, the pennsylvania constitution has a prohibition on us competing with private business, so we're not permitted to do that work. we can only address those trees that are impacting the right of way or public utilities. you know the public benefit. however, an organization called the mexico public tree team rubicon, which is a national volunteer-based emergency response organization, has responded to this disaster. they are available to assist residents with those types of situations and they have been folded into the county, the, the region-wide response efforts, and so dispatching for them is being handled through 211, which is a public service organization. that is a national volunteer based emergency response organization, and they are also a part of the community service organization, which is the human services resource line. so there are a lot of services available for residents through 211 at all times, in particular as a result of this storm. one of those is that if they call 211 or go to pa211. org, they can be, they can provide their information regarding a tree. that will be routed to team rubicon. they will come out and do an assessment, determine whether they can be of assistance and they can be of assistance, and they can be of assistance and they can be of assistance if they can, then a crew will help. okay, i think. thank you for that and i know, you know we're still, you know, in in the midst of it and i can't report that. that i, i do think that you know those folks who were disappointed yesterday and not getting their power back on, i think you know today seems more favorable about my wife actually just texted me and said our power just came back on. congratulations, absolutely, absolutely welcome back to the 21st century. yeah, just in, you know, in, in, in. well, that's a follow-up question, but actually my next question is specifically around the emergency, you know, declaration you talked about. you know contractual, yeah, flexibility that it creates is there, are there any other elements that you haven't discussed that also fall within the purview of the emergency declaration, beyond contractual flexibility, yeah, yeah, yeah, i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. the, the i, if i could, on that point too, i just want to make clear: we've not utilized, nor do we anticipate having to utilize, that contractual flexibility in this instance, okay, the contracted services that the city has utilized in this storm are under existing contracts with tree service providers that we already had under contract. so there have been instances under declared emergencies where we did take advantage of that, but needed to do that in this case and don't anticipate it. generally speaking, right, the disaster response, there are broad flexibilities related to disaster response that are permitted when a disaster is declared and- and the examples i use about, like waiving of fees or making certain exceptions to standard procedures are: are the, the, the powers that are extended there, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the powers that are extended there, the. I anticipate that those that we've already done seem to be the limit of what we anticipate needing to do in this disaster. Again, it's the primary role at this point is in the documentation to state and federal agencies regarding the outcomes of the storm And the question I was going to ask right before. my second question is- and I know that we're still in the midst of it, my power just came on 10 minutes ago, But just in light of what happened, are there any plans of convening with Duquesne Light and the other stakeholders and kind of having a debrief and assessing and looking at lessons learned. You know, in the process of- I don't know if we have one on paper, but thinking about a resiliency plan for the region, given the reality of extreme weather events and climate change and how it's changing our region, We anticipate, if the restoration estimates hold true and the last folks who lost power in the storm are restored today, that's when we'll formally close the Emergency Operations Center, Which is the last one that we're going to close. So I'm just wondering if you have any plans to do that. Yeah, I think the first thing I would say is that we are going to continue to work with the disaster response and recovery portion of the effort and begin those conversations again. if everyone is restored today, as we expect to be the case, that would begin tomorrow. But yes, you're correct, Councilman, that that is the next step in this process And we've been planning for that. but I would say those conversations would begin in earnest as soon as we close down the sort of in the thick of it, if you will- phase of the response Which remains open and active until next year. So those last folks are restored. And my last question was- and again, like many of the other members of Council shout out to Emily, Yonan and Luis and the folks that are, who are our liaisons With Duquesne Light and I know, anecdotally, Emily, you know I mentioned this was the worst damage they have ever experienced. Does that job with the conversations that you've had? Absolutely. You know with the other folks that you talk a little bit about, you know the sheer magnitude you know of this storm compared to other storms and how you know it behooves us to in the future, you know, be more prepared, being that weather is changing. We're getting weather we've never seen in this region before. Right, I mean, this is this event is not identical but in many ways similar to last year's storm event in western North Carolina And eastern Tennessee or 2022's major flooding in eastern Kentucky. Right, I mean, these are weather patterns that are have not been typical to the Appalachian region in the past, that are happening with increased frequency as a result of climate change And that requires significant adaptation. Right, We will need to explore ways in which our infrastructure and our response posture need to be adjusted to this new reality. That's a there have been efforts underway in this direction. It is a focus of the ongoing work around the comprehensive plan, which also includes the development of a hazard mitigation plan, for exactly that reason. But I think the lessons learned from this firsthand example will be important inputs to those ongoing efforts. Thank you, Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Any further discussion? No, Okay, Thank you, Thank you, I do have a question. Council Round two. Yeah, Councilman, Councilperson Charlon, first round, And then we'll see if there's any other first round. All right, Thank you, Thank you for being here. So this brings up a really- and it's interesting, David, that you're here for this, because this is something you and I have talked about for years now. The scenario that happens all too often this time of year in my district has been happening for years where someone- be it on abandoned property, walkway property, whatever it might be- someone has a tree that is falling on someone else's or looking to fall on someone else's house And we do not have the authority to go do anything to help there. I remember calling, screaming, begging, crying to the URA: please help me, because we've got programs to help once the tree falls on someone's house. We do not have programs to help that tree from falling on someone's house, And it begs the question of: is there something we can do in terms of our emergency management powers, when this inevitably will happen next year- maybe not a storm of this magnitude, but eventually the soil will be softened, trees will start to lean and we'll have senior citizens calling the office saying: I can't pay for a new roof. And all I can say is that, well, when you do need a new roof, we've got programs for you, but we don't have the money. We don't have the money, We can't help you with that tree that's about to fall over here. And sometimes we can get the cowboy churches to go and do some illegal chainsaw work and go onto someone's property that no one would stop them from doing. But is a method like this something that we could possibly use to prevent those situations in the future? So, could we like, could we? is there a way to use our emergency powers for good? Well, I think we are already doing that, Not for the specific use case you're mentioning, which I do think is well worth considering, studying, analyzing, as part of the conversations that Deputy Mayor Pollack was just mentioning, that we're having, And I think that's something that we will immediately be pivoting to over the course of the next day or so, I think. that idea amongst many ideas that have been raised and, you know, please continue to let us know as those come up. I think all of those should be considered for that sort of postmortem on this storm and future planning for resiliency, whether it's around direct emergency management or, as Councilman Mosley brought up, sort of in general the needing to plan, for, you know, climate change and its realities, for you know the City of Pittsburgh and our region, Trees, specifically, are going to have to be a focal point of that analysis, both the immediate aftermath analysis of this event and incorporated into planning for these types of storm events into the future. right, We're rightfully very proud of our robust and growing tree canopy. You know they're not, you know they're not going to be the same as they were in the past. There are many cities that are not seeing the type of tree canopy growth that Pittsburgh has been fortunate to see over the last decade. But the health and condition of some of those trees clearly contributed to the amount of tree falls we had as a part of this storm. You're right, Councilmember, many of those trees are on private property or even in property with tangled title, which presents real, unfortunate and, I agree with you, very frustrating challenges as relates to property rights that are difficult to untangle. I think it is possible that there may be some relief available under the status of a declared emergency. I don't. we would need some legal guidance to further refine our understanding of that. But thank you for raising, bringing that sort of chronic issue into the context of this example, So we can certainly include that. Thank you, Thank you, I'll include that in the analysis. Yeah, I mean, it's something that I remember talking about in your office with you as a staffer, because I was the person you know talking to, you know the senior trying to talk them off the ledge here. You know, I do hope that this is the time that you do take that seriously. I do want to also offer this idea of this emergency declaration of we can enter private property. You know I have been on this very different issue But on this concept of emergency declaration because of our inability to manage trash, And is there a way that we could locally make that designation so that we could enter private property and clean up some of the constant issues that we have in our city with our with, you know, abandoned vacant properties that are have become dumping sites? I just, I do want to be clear that the even in our city, we have a lot of issues, We have a lot of problems, We have a lot of problems And I think that you know, even in our current situation, right, the limit of the intervention on private property that we're currently undertaking and we believe is what we're unable to do at this time, is to intervene on trees that you know when they were standing were on private property but are now impacting the public right of way, Things that would have been challenges under other circumstances. And I bring that to the table. I think that's a really important point And I bring that up to say that it would depend on the interpretation, I suppose, of the impact of something occurring on property outside of that property, Again, from a legal perspective, something that we would need more guidance on. I know we feel very comfortable and confident in the case for the types of work we're doing now to get the roadways and sidewalks reopened. and you know, assist Duquesne-Lightning, Thank you very much. know, assist duke and item restoring power. i don't know that that emergency authority would extend as far as you're asking. i'm not saying that it doesn't, i'm saying that's a a a question that i can't answer sitting here today. yeah, i would like to have clarification on what a disaster is. i think that our trash situation is a disaster by any. any of my residents would say that. so i i would like to understand what you mean by disaster, what, what we actually constitute as a disaster. obviously, this is, you know, i, you know, sometimes we, we learn our abilities of what we can do and what's possible through through emergencies, things like this that you know, that force us to to open up a different part of code. i hope this is something that we can use that for and we can, you know, figure out how to better serve residents. you know, in this time, i i do want to go to another issue, though, that i think we've all become aware of, and that is who was in charge of the emergency management coordination? the office of emergency management and homeland security is the primary entity within city government for managing emergency response, and who's in charge of that? chief daryl jones is the, in addition to being chief of the fire bureau, is the emergency management coordinator, and adam emil is the deputy emergency management coordinator within the office of emergency management. and where was chief jones during this time? in the initial. on the day of the the storm, he was outside of the city for training purposes. i don't recall off the top of my head where he was. adam emil, the deputy, as part of the deputy designation, led the initial opening of the emergency operations center and the coordination with outside agencies. when did he return? i, i don't recall at the top of my head is he here now? yes, has council been notified of this? i'm not aware. okay, i i am. we were not notified. okay, it continues to be a problem with notifying council, you know, with absentee letters. it's, you know, something i brought up last year continues to be an issue now in the. this is exactly why we have those policies in place. i was taking calls from, from lee schmidt, which you know. i thought that he was running coordination for us, which was, you know, could have been really helpful, but he was chief jones was was not here for that. well, i should make a distinction. right, like the, the office of emergency management is part of the department of public safety is part of the department of public safety, right, is it required to have a safety? so there was an hirekeeper who made these process the marathon to have a care exercise. So the entire staff there ultimately report to Director Schmidt, who was directly and intimately involved in every step of the emergency recovery effort and is one of the two appointed emergency managers in the declaration of emergency, which has a different definition or criteria for what that status means. When I say that the Office of Emergency Management is the primary agency in leading disaster response, they are the conveners. They run the emergency operations center meetings, They set that schedule, They are the focal point of communication between all of the agencies that participate in the EOC. So they're the clearinghouse of information, and that was a duty that Adam Amil conducted in this case in his capacity as deputy. Ultimately, the full authority for disaster response decision-making runs up from the emergency management coordinator, whether that be Chief Jones or his deputy, through the normal decision-making chain of command all the way up to the mayor. As to notification, I can inquire with the Department of Public Safety. They submit those on behalf of personnel in the Fire Bureau. Yeah, I don't know. I mean we've had this conversation that this is a problem with this administration not notifying us when people are out of town. This is exactly why You know, if an emergency happens like this, we need to know who is coordinating these efforts. I applaud Director Schmidt for being. you know, I've never had to reach out to Director Schmidt before for public works issues. He handled it. Oh, there he is. He handled it very well And I, you know, I appreciate those efforts. But as to, you know, we are, we're, we have somebody whose job it is to do this, who we pay to do this, and they're out of town and we don't know why or how, or who's in charge. So with that, those are my questions. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Councilwoman Kale Smith, followed by anyone else for first round before I move on to Sacramento. Thank you. I actually brought up the question about Chief Jones yesterday for the first time, wondering where he was through the emergency management, because the response has been: there's still people without power and there's still people without food and there's still people struggling, And it's not just because the city 9 1: 1 went down. We had no backup plan on our own. I don't know what their backup plan was. We had people calling the stations, the police stations, but in some cases there's not people at the police stations. So there's just a lot of communication that we've had. We've had a lot of questions. We've had calls from the police stations, We've had a lot of questions from the police stations, but we haven't been able to find them. We haven't been able to find them. But I think, you know, I think the most important thing is that we don't want to be a burden on the city. We don't want to be a burden on the city. But I think, you know, we issues and there's a lot of communication people in your office now, but the communication issues are with us and those people we deal directly with our. we deal directly with the public. but what i'm going to say is that that position that chief jones has now was put in place, same with omb under bill peduto, and i actually think that chief jones does an amazing job when he's here. he's extremely knowledgeable. so i don't want to, i don't want to say anything negative about chief jones. it's and i think that director schmidt has been very responsive, extremely responsive to all of us. but for me it's what. what is our plan for when emergencies happen? we have when natalia, when luke ravenstahl was in office, a 27 year old was in office as mayor. he was slammed over snowmageddon because he went away for his birthday for a couple days. that was snowmageddon. it was feet of snow, it was it. it was a larger disaster. all of the snowmageddon was a larger disaster, and the snowmageddon was a larger disaster and over the place. and yet people slammed him in the middle of the entire emergency, took you know, and then natalia rudyak at the time decided that she was going to put a plan in place for snow removal, which basically ended up being the exact plan that they were doing anyway, but now it's just a policy in pay on paper, but it has always been their practice. so my concern is, you know, if we're going to question somebody over- and i don't like the political part of this- i think when it comes to public safety, there should. there's no room for politics. i mean, we really need to come together and work together on this whole thing, because that the safety of the public should be our top priority. and so for me, my concern is: we have never had a position before that we paid. it was always the public safety director, and i just think that the communication needs to be better between when something happens, what's going, what's going to happen, how are we feeding our residents? i mean, it's my understanding. i sent a text to director schmidt saying that the salvation army was trying to reach the city, saying that they had a lot of resources, but nobody was responding back to them. he fortunately did make sure that that connection happened. and then there were, you know, people, obviously, with trees and wires and all those other things, and you know three tragedies and i mean thank god there wasn't more, because it really had the potential to be much more significant than what it was. and my concern is, i think, moving forward, we need to be more responsible for the safety of the public, safety of the city, and i think that's what we need to do and i know that's what i've been doing for a long time. i've been working for a long time and i'm working for a long time and i know that we need to work together on plans for any type of catastrophe that could happen, any time type of emergency. so you know we can't predict everything, but we basically know floods, trees, you know, lightning storms, terrorist attacks are all things that are possible. so those are things that i think that we need to, you know, sit down together and work collectively on, and i think it would be helpful if all of council worked with the administration and the, the director, on coming up with something, but also with the county, because when 9-1-1 went, i don't know what their back is, but i think it's really important. and then i think it's really important to work with the city and the. I don't know what their backup plan was. May I address that point specifically, Councilwoman? Yeah, And this was a clarification that was identified on Wednesday, the day after the storm, And it's important for the sake of clarity for the public and their understanding. The 911 center itself never went out of operation. That was widely believed to be true Tuesday night for a short, brief period of time. What happened is that the number of calls that were coming in overwhelmed the telecommunication infrastructure, So some folks were not able to get through. But it is important that folks understand that the 911 center remained operational, even on backup power, the entire time. That doesn't mean that some folks were not able to reach 911, And it was during that brief window of time that the Public Safety Department advised folks to call stations when we were hearing from residents that they couldn't get through at 911. But I just want to say for the sake of the county in their briefing to us the next day that the 911 center did not become disoperational. So I will say this: During Snowmageddon, I also volunteered for my husband and I both volunteered for 311. We went to the 311 center and we just started helping. You just wanted to pitch in As a city To help get us through a crisis, And so we went to the 311 center. But there's no center anymore. They're not working from home, And so I think what is the backup plan? if we do need a call center, Is there some place that we could tap into that maybe we can work with people and get people to help? I don't know all the details, So that's why I just want to have those conversations, But I also the email that went out. I'll be honest with you, My husband was going through heart problems that week And all kinds of stuff was going on, And so I thought, when I saw that text that said, or the tweet that said, to call- here's a link to call your zones for help- I panicked because I'm thinking he has a heart. I'm going to have to look up that number and do all this Like where I'm so used to calling 911. So I just think having some kind of like other plan, Calling the zones is the established backup response if 911 were to go down Or in a case like this. it's not down, But, as you know, we don't always have officers there Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right Right At the zone. We've heard that repeatedly throughout this past year. Yeah, I am aware of that concern And we would need the director or the police to answer this question. I believe that the procedure is, when we are making those notifications, to ensure that there is someone there to answer the phone, Even if that's not the case 100% of the time. I would like to just address your the larger context of your question, Because I think it does answer many of the items that you brought up. It was an initiative of Chief Jones' to begin work earlier this year on a hazard mitigation plan, which is a standard in the emergency response practitioners. The emergency managers across the country have what's called a hazard mitigation plan. that is intended to achieve exactly what you're saying, which is have standard response plans for these types of emergencies. Historically, the city of Pittsburgh has used the county's emergency management plan as our emergency management plan, The idea being we fold into their planning effort. This would be the first time that the city would establish its own plan, And so the questions you're asking are exactly the same questions that the Office of Emergency Management and the Planning Department are beginning to, and that's what we're trying to work on right now, And I think there is ample opportunity to, and it will require the engagement of all the stakeholders in finalizing those plans, But they've initiated that work earlier this year. It's in its preliminary stages right now. Okay, so I just wanna say to that I think that we should have had a plan in place. I believe we do have some plans somewhere that I remember people working on previously, So I'll try to track down something. I don't mean to suggest that there aren't a variety of plans, standard operating procedures, tourros or partnerships in that regard. I think it may be, and I think that we look at the organization withinWell, and it is kind of an êm- in the context of the pulling in all of the relevant agencies for coordination, The Emergency Operations Center met regularly- sometimes virtually because folks were in the field participating in the response, sometimes in person- at the Physical Emergency Operations Center on Railroad Street in the Strip District for the purposes of coordinating response activities That included not just city agencies but also county liaisons, representatives of Duquesne Light, representatives of the charitable or nonprofit human service agencies like. forgive me the example, I'm losing the example I meant to bring up, but there are numerous of those folks who participate. What I don't wanna do is belabor this point at the table right now, but I do wanna have this conversation because there's a lot that I can say and a lot I wanna say, and I'm not trying to make it political myself. so I would like to have that conversation at a different time, But I do think it's a conversation we all need to have, Absolutely, Thank you. Thank you, First round Council Member Gross. Thank you, I appreciate it. I'll keep it relatively brief. This declaration of emergency is for 30 days. I don't think anyone's actually it was read at the title of the bill, but I just wanted to remind people because we've- most of us were here during COVID and we voted on kind of repeating these declarations of emergency. So, just as a reminder for the public, it is only for 30 days and it allows things like renting equipment instead of waiting for a multi-week process that goes by presenting legislation and amending a budget and getting it back to you and all that kind of stuff So you could go out and rent equipment and things like that. It's also my recollection that early in COVID, in the previous administration, it was used to purchase questionable surveillance software And that I later, kind of a year later, when Council was asked to renew software, I said- I don't remember voting on this the first time And the answer was: oh well, we bought it under emergency services. So what I'm looking for in this administration is that there's a commitment that there is that when you get this permission- which you have now, because you have it under the first seven weeks for the American Declaration, or the first seven days- that you will not be buying services or things that are unrelated to the current emergency. You have that commitment, Thank you, thank you. I think we should also receive a report, click what was like a consolidated report of what was purchased. At this point we haven't utilized the emergency powers, to my knowledge, to purchase anything. We can certainly if there were incidental purchases of like personal protective equipment that I might not be aware of right now. like we can certainly compile that discoveries, Right, But my- Right Right- I mean after the staff- Right Right, Like personal protective equipment that I might not be aware of right now, like we can certainly compile that. But my- Right, Right, I mean after the staff-, after the 30, after the emergency. I think there should be a record of what was purchased so that it's just we can attach it to the public record and we can all see this was used for what it was intended for. I wholeheartedly concur with that assessment. My broader point is we do not at this time anticipate needing to use those procurement powers for anything in this emergency. Of course, that is subject to change as we learn more about conditions. For whatever it's used for, there should be a consolidated report and that we can review it so that we can see that it is constant with the intent. Sure, absolutely Perfect, that's it. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, I know Councilman Coghill was interested in a comment second round, and so in the interim I will just state that I've been very aware that Councilmember Warwick called for a post-agenda hearing mostly focused on Duquesne Light, And I was gonna wait until after we talked to kind of understand the scope of that. but I think what I'm gonna do at the end of this meeting is call for a hearing. that is, I think, a slightly different topic, which is discussing what we've all been discussing here today. after you've been able to go through the deep dive with Duquesne Light and understand the process and ways to improve, I think it would be helpful for us and for the public to hear the results of that discussion publicly, And so I think the hearing that I'd like to hold would be more, I think, more focused on a plan for future emergency responses, as climate disasters increase in frequency and possibly even again dependent on what is discussed at the Duquesne Light hearing- mitigation strategies like proactively and then in the moment what the response looks like. Happy to call for that today and then cancel it if that's actually not necessary, if that's actually gonna be included in the one that Councilwoman Warwick called for. So just wanted to state that A little stalling tactic until we move to second round while Councilman Coggle got back. Thank you, Madam Chair. So just I'll be brief. The emergency help that we get from Alabama, from wherever right, who pays for them? Do they get the funds? And if so, do we, Because I know we go out also right? That is coordinated by Duquesne Light. So Duquesne Light has what they call mutual aid agreements with other electric utilities. They send Duquesne Light crews to respond to disasters in other parts of the country under those agreements, And then those utilities also send crews here when we have a disaster- Perfect. So all of that is coordinated through Duquesne Light, The private utilities. we don't have to front a dime. Nobody has to deal with money going back and forth for their services, It's all done. I don't just for the sake of clarity. I don't know if there's cost sharing as part of those agreements between the utilities. It does not involve the city of the public. That's all matters to me. Somebody's paying them, you know, as long as everybody's compensated in whatever way. I'm sure they have it figured out, Not our responsibility, Got it Okay. so the other thing was- and I was talking to Director Schmidt, which thank you, Director, for keeping me well informed as to how things unfolded and you know power lines and outages and stuff like that. I don't want to have to call you up here because I don't think you need to. But one concern I had. I had many parts of the city of my neighborhoods were severed off right, Couldn't get in with an automobile, couldn't get out. There's only one road in one road out. big trees this big around that. we couldn't move, we couldn't touch because we were waiting for Duquesne Light, who were overwhelmed, and you know the story goes on. So I did think and I did work, I did a lot of work on the city but I didn't have a story about. because I was asked and I thought I don't know, to be honest with you, Like what if somebody took a cardiac arrest a tenth of a mile down from where that tree came down across the road right Now? Director Schmidt and I talked about this and I was. my nerves were put to ease just by talking to him and it's kind of what I assumed. And you mentioned our firefighters earlier. Well, if we needed to get six firefighters there with a stretcher, we'll get in and we'll get out and we'll get them out And the help that they need. But I didn't know if we had a broader, you know more like a safety plan, Like is there a like? do we have to do it on the whim or is there a strategic plan in place where it's like- and I keep using firefighters just because there's such able-bodied force that we have in this situation crawling over, going through power lines and trying to get somebody out of a bad situation, I don't know who else we would have to do such a thing, And my question is: do we have a plan- and I've heard other members talking about getting a safety plan in place- I'd rather I'd like to have something black and white that says, yes, firefighters will be called in or a certain whoever, it might be Army National Guard, I don't know. Yeah, What you describe is the plan right. So that's the reason that you know, or that's one of the many reasons, that firefighters dispatch to those types of calls Right On a daily basis, Right On a routine basis. And you're correct: In an instance where you know the roadway isn't accessible, in circumstances like these, the emergency service members- fire, EMS, police- will coordinate to evacuate someone safely, even from a place where they can't get to by a vehicle. We also documented instances where that was the case either through visual observation from any member of the city's staff. you know, DPW, DOME, fire EMS police were observing those things and reporting them in. They were then communicated to Duquesne Light through the Emergency Operations Center to be prioritized for inspection by them to get the power lines addressed so that we could then cut up the trees Right. So there is a standard procedure and it is exactly what you said. Good, We know, we identify and know where these places are Right, And so we know what we'll need to respond to them until we can get them cleared, And then we also put them at the top of the priority list for clearance. Yep, As good as our public safety is- I figured there was, but I couldn't speak exactly to it. Sure, So it would be good if I had something like: yeah, so and so gets called first, and then if they're not available or they're overwhelmed, then we bring in the forces from here. just something more. eventually, you know, in a document, I guess, type thing that we could actually speak to. Yeah, other than PLI, you know which, you put that to rest which, thank you, you know they can. you know they have three-day grace period, I guess, to apply for such permits so they don't have to wait for our process. And so, other than that was the actual, again, having people severed off, and whether it's not just cardiac arrest or emergency or that situation, it's getting them water or whatever it is, you know. so, Okay, I mean, it's obviously there's nothing. well, a natural disaster, right? We can't control which trees fall and you know, the ideal solution would not to be to not have any dead end streets. but those were decisions made a long time ago, Right? So the best we can do in those circumstances is identify those barriers quickly and eliminate them quickly, Right, And Pittsburgh's such a great town, like everybody just pitches in. the neighbors pitch in, Absolutely. You know everybody's kind of all hands on deck. at least in my neighborhoods It's everybody's out to help each other. so, Okay, That's it for me, Madam Chair. All in all, I will say: you know, I think, you know, I think our public works, our public safety, did a great job and as good a job as can be expected under those circumstances, and the same with Duquesne Light as well. I would say They're again getting the brunt of the. they're getting beat up today by many different media outlets, but all in all, I really feel like they did as good a job as they could under this. They had a great answer. They really did, They really did, And I would, I will say, on behalf of the administration and just our efforts, being part of the coordination, I mean the entire, you know, team, including public safety, public works. they were very helpful and forthcoming in the coordination efforts. I could tell. I could tell. I watched the interviews and things. yeah, So I could tell they were fully engaged and, you know, trying to just help out as best they could. So thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you Any further for second round: Seeing none. all those in favor of bill of supplemental bill 18. 2. please indicate by saying aye, Aye. Affirmative recommendation. Thank you very much.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

Second Discussion. Council Member Warbick. I just I don't know if. what extra powers does this give? I'm just kind of curious. It's a fair question. I don't know the answer. I'd like to call anyone who can answer to the table. Take Mr Geiger. Good morning, David Geiger. Director of Legislation and Policy. I believe Deputy Mayor Pawlak may be joining for this discussion if needed. but, in short, the emergency declaration powers allow us to waive certain contracting provisions as well as move more quickly in ways that we normally can't. So I don't believe we've used the contracting powers, the expedited contracting powers, but one of the things that workers have been able to do is access private property quicker than they otherwise would have for downed trees, Things of that nature. So are we just so I'm clear when I talk to residents. so if someone has a, so obviously, if it's a street tree, we are. well, I guess I should, I'll like, I guess I should. well, I guess I should, I'll like. if it's a street tree, are we, you know, coming in and helping get it out of the way? you know, if it's a, if it's on a private like, if it's the trees on private property and falling on private property, are we intervene? just to understand for folks when we're talking to residents. the office of management budget, the emergency declaration, in broadly emergency declarations, are not required by the emergency declaration. the emergency declaration is a blanket waiver of competitive process when related to disaster response activities. however, in this case, the primary reason for the declaration of the emergency and the extension relates to the documentation of the emergency and the extension relates to the documentation of the emergency procurement process, documentation of disaster response activities for potential future financial support for either from the state or federal government. so the assessment is done by the office of emergency management and homeland security. they begin assessing damage and documenting it in the immediate aftermath of the storm. that analysis is ongoing. thus far they've primarily been assembling documentation and then, as the emergency response activity activities conclude, they'll begin analyzing that documentation for the purposes of submitting reports to FEMA and, potentially, FEMA. We don't yet know whether the costs associated with the storm response will qualify for aid, but the emergency declarations are an important prerequisite to being in that position. In terms of utilization of powers provided under an emergency declaration, the two examples that I can provide right now- I believe these are the only two instances where those have been used- is the waiver of fees for residents to drop off yard waste at our yard waste collection locations throughout the city as folks are cleaning up trees and other debris on their own property And limited. I don't know. I'm not sure if they're in the right place to say that. It's a little bit of a. I think a lot of the time. it's, you know, just a number of times. it's just a number of times where there's sort of a city worker activity on private property where a downed tree is both blocking the right-of-way or otherwise imperiling public safety or the storm response, but where the tree itself is a privately owned tree that we wouldn't normally engage with. So under normal circumstances, if a tree is in the middle of your front yard, it falls, responsibility for clearing that tree would be on the property owner. Under these circumstances, if that's the case and it is only affecting your property, we're still not, you know, having city workers engage in that work, although team rubicon, an outside non-profit agency that assists with disaster response, is available to do that work. but where a privately owned tree falls into the right of way or in in some other fashion is creating a health and safety risk, under the emergency declaration we're allowed to do some work on across that line. okay, that might be helpful. just about the trees, because i know a lot of people are just sort of like: yeah, you know, i have this giant tree and it's just, you know. i mean, i had a tree fall, not in this storm but previously, and it was a small train. i think i paid like something like two thousand dollars and it was a very small tree. so, yeah, i hope i didn't, councilman coggill, i hope i didn't. just just to emphasize, for for general awareness, all allegheny county residents, not just city of pittsburgh residents who are- have had trees fall or that type of damage on their property that is not being addressed by emergency responders because it's not imperiling the power lines or the right-of-way they should call, or can call 211 or go to pa211. org and they'll be connected with an operator. they, if they explain to them that that's the issue they're dealing with, that information will be sent to team rubicon who will then come out and do an assessment. okay, okay. and then the other question i had, because i- someone asked me about this and i wasn't sure have: has the state, has governor shapiro declared a state of emergency? no, and is that something that we are would like him to? would that be helpful to? i mean, i, you know, i know that there's just a handful of folks, but but people still don't have power. the pennsylvania emergency management agency, pima, has their own criteria for assessing when the state should declare an emergency. it's my understanding that those have not been met, that it's a decision whether or not to declare a state of emer. a commonwealth level state of emergency is a decision for for them and something that they undertake under their own criteria. so at this time, the local emergency declaration at the city level- and the county has also declared one- were deemed appropriate, based on our emergency response agencies, for the purposes of our own response, the, the state determination is is up to them. and i guess one last thing- and this is not something that i've asked, but i've had a few residents mention it is because it has been so long at this point- is: would it be possible for neighborhood services, or something like that, to go and actually do maybe some of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the door knocking in these like small sections where people have not had power now for gosh, eight days? yeah, just to- even if it's not something that we can like- do anything with getting the power on, just to kind of say: you know, yeah, we're here, is there anything just to make sure that everybody- i mean i think people, at least in my district, i think people do have what they need? but just to kind of be a hundred percent sure it's not something that neighborhood services specifically has done. there have been coordinated efforts of community-based and volunteer organizations doing some of that work. That's something I can certainly take back By way of an update- and this is Duquesne Light's update, not ours, but their latest estimates are that of individuals who lost power last Tuesday, As of last night, only 1,000 in their entire service area were still without power. So 1,000 folks for 1,000 folks. they did not meet the restoration time they had planned out for last night and those folks should be reactivated tomorrow- I'm sorry, by tonight. so they will have their power back on by tomorrow. There are, again, according to them, an additional 5,000 individuals who lost power at some point later in one of the subsequent rain events, again across their service area, who also have an estimated recovery time of 11: 30 pm tonight. So their projection is that they came 6,000 customers total short of their estimate, but that they expect every one of those to be addressed today. Okay, okay, And I don't actually know, like on Phillips Place and Beachwood. I have not checked in this morning yet so I don't know if they're on or not. Is it on? It will be tonight? It will be tonight, right, Okay? Yeah, everyone should be restored sometime today according to Duquesne Light's estimates. Got it, Got it, Okay. I think that's it for me. Thank you, Councilman Coghill, followed by Councilman Mosley. Thank you, Madam Chair. Morning David and Jake, How are you? Just a couple of clarification things while I was out there in the field, I guess you could say over a couple days there of the storm. We are not responsible for any tree from city property, whether it's a city paper street, whether it's city property, whether it's a park. If it falls on to somebody's home, we have no liability there, right? It's their homeowners or their car, or you know? is that accurate If it comes from a park, I believe. let me get you a firm answer. I believe those individuals could submit claims. Mm-hmm, The more cost. Yes, Yes, That's right. Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, It's a common issue. is a tree on private property falls, falls on the same property and does damage, or falls across a property line onto a neighbor's property, And those are all private disputes. Absolutely, That needs to be handled. But the insurance companies battle that out. that's not our problem. right, That's correct. But the reason I ask, I guess I don't know. Again, I'm just trying to be accurate, being out there. reason: I asked, I guess what? I don't know me again. I I'm just trying to be accurate, Being out there, I was just tell people because I know we are not responsible or don't take responsibility for cutting trees down that are on city paper streets, for instance, no matter if they're in- yeah, Joe, falling on to somebody's home. We don't do that as a service necessarily. we they're allowed to do it. we give them permission to do it or pay for it. The paper streets is the element of your question that I want to give misleading information on, because I don't, I don't know Off the top, my head got got OK. at the same time, if somebody's tree and some private property comes down on one of our dump trucks, across the hood of one of our dump trucks, do we file claim? then obviously, with that homeowners, We would. It depend on the circumstance. you know where there We. if a falling tree fell that caused damage to a city vehicle, we would probably pursue that through, you know, our self insurance and potentially there's. We don't do that for privately owned trees that fall in the right way of the sidewalk, even if that requires some repair work on our part So that they are that storm. I was at the fiori's pizza shop on West of the Avenue. I saw you know that. I know very well we call me. I'm a roofing contractors. report right, so I was there and not a job for me. I said first of all that, secondly, I worried, Or I was wondering like so. so they were working there that night. OK, makes on the place rebuilding the roof. lot of work, very lot of work there. I was shocked there, done probably. I'm not that they're not done, but they're. you know, I'm yeah, roof and dry, probably within 24 hours, 36 hours, somewhere, like that. just about yes, yeah, so it's what is it Situation? now I again I was worried like, oh my gosh, are going to call me about the I something's you know, and condemned it and I thought, oh my God, with, Everything seem to go smooth. nobody called me. so, yeah, because of the declaration of emergency, was he able to pursue it's that work with out? it's not. it's not letting itself. it's not related to a declaration of emergency, but it is related to provisions of the building code that relate to natural Disaster Disasters. you are permitted to begin repair work Caused by a natural disaster and have 3 days to file for the permits. so you, for you, have for 3 days, a 3 day grace period where you can be proceeding with work while simultaneously getting your permits. I wish I'd known it that, But I would have slept a lot easier. but I thought, oh my gosh, are going to call me in the morning saying we were alive, stuck a blue sticker on us, we're not at work, or the permits, and we were in contact At that time. communication and their rights to read your letter at. we did condemn the building for a time. oh, you have to because it was unsafe, right? this is an important clarification. condemnation does not mean The building is dead and it must be demolished. I think sometimes people hear the term condemnation. I think that what condemnation means is occupancy is prohibited except for I work to conduct repairs, right, and so that was the state the building was. and, as you said, I believe it was just just under the Building, right, And so that was the state the building was in. as you said, I believe it was just under the about 36 hours they were able to install a temporary roof. well, it's not temp. they were able to do enough work on the roof to then have occupancy restored for the first and second floor by i believe that was friday, yeah, it doesn't, and they reopened. well, i'm thankful that that was the process. i i wish again like i knew that that way i could have probably slept better that night, but i really didn't know and all i know is i was getting calls from other things and hoping that went smooth. so it did, and work there is ongoing for full restoration, but they're operational while that's happening, right, right. and then you know, i'll say this about duquesne light. emily was like a rock star for me. she picked up the phone, she they're taking a lot of heat today and you know, because, responding, there were people from alabama putting up lines in brookline. there were people from erie and cleveland and every municipality that you can drive to within 24 hours. probably. i don't know how far alabama is, but you know, maybe they flew in, i don't know, but they brought their own trucks today. yeah, right, yeah, they need to bring their equipment right. so it really was an unprecedented storm: lines down everywhere, twisted up. frustrating thing was we couldn't as public works. people were like: why can't they move the tree after? well, it has to be safe, right? i mean, the lines are down and, yes, without that clearance. so that was really the most frustrating thing, i would say. but i will say this: our public works crew kicked ass. they did, really did it. they're very true and if i, when they could, when they were allowed to, you know if i could just add to that. i also want to extend some gratitude to the bureau of fire. yes, fire fighters were attached to dpw crews and in some instances- not all- in some instances they were able to use their training to identify whether a line was hot or not and that allowed us to proceed with some tree work before duke and light was able to get to an area, which made the response quicker. to make a clear determination, they moved on and we did wait for duke and light, but that was an an important assist that we got from. that's a good point. i feel like our firefighters can do anything, even including helping out with the police department at some point, without talking about union lines or anything like that. but, yeah, you know, patrolling downtown, i'm telling you right now, our firefighters are are the best they really are. they're just good people, always looking to help, and very expertise in many, many fields, not just fighting fires. you know they were, they were essential as part of this response for sure, absolutely, absolutely, so okay, that's clarifies things for me. i i, if i can get clarification on the tree situation. i don't have that instance, by the way, which i'm glad, but it could have happened so easily. i mean, we can find out about the paper streets present, a unique example that i just don't want to be incorrect on, but we'll find that out and i get a lot of calls, people worried that a tree on our paper street are going to fall onto their home, not just during the storm, but you pretty much, yeah, year long. you know, understood, okay, thanks, appreciate it. thank you, councilman mosley. thank you, yeah, i just wanted to elaborate a little bit. you know, on some of the questions that have been raised specifically around. you know private trees on private property. you were saying that you know folks should reach out to 211. yeah, in that instance could you just talk a little bit? yeah, more detail for the public. so so, to reiterate, a public tree that has fallen on or done damage on private property, the city is not permitted or the county government agencies are not permitted to go to do that work. right, the pennsylvania constitution has a prohibition on us competing with private business, so we're not permitted to do that work. we can only address those trees that are impacting the right of way or public utilities. you know the public benefit. however, an organization called the mexico public tree team rubicon, which is a national volunteer-based emergency response organization, has responded to this disaster. they are available to assist residents with those types of situations and they have been folded into the county, the, the region-wide response efforts, and so dispatching for them is being handled through 211, which is a public service organization. that is a national volunteer based emergency response organization, and they are also a part of the community service organization, which is the human services resource line. so there are a lot of services available for residents through 211 at all times, in particular as a result of this storm. one of those is that if they call 211 or go to pa211. org, they can be, they can provide their information regarding a tree. that will be routed to team rubicon. they will come out and do an assessment, determine whether they can be of assistance and they can be of assistance, and they can be of assistance and they can be of assistance if they can, then a crew will help. okay, i think. thank you for that and i know, you know we're still, you know, in in the midst of it and i can't report that. that i, i do think that you know those folks who were disappointed yesterday and not getting their power back on, i think you know today seems more favorable about my wife actually just texted me and said our power just came back on. congratulations, absolutely, absolutely welcome back to the 21st century. yeah, just in, you know, in, in, in. well, that's a follow-up question, but actually my next question is specifically around the emergency, you know, declaration you talked about. you know contractual, yeah, flexibility that it creates is there, are there any other elements that you haven't discussed that also fall within the purview of the emergency declaration, beyond contractual flexibility, yeah, yeah, yeah, i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. i think that's a good question. the, the i, if i could, on that point too, i just want to make clear: we've not utilized, nor do we anticipate having to utilize, that contractual flexibility in this instance, okay, the contracted services that the city has utilized in this storm are under existing contracts with tree service providers that we already had under contract. so there have been instances under declared emergencies where we did take advantage of that, but needed to do that in this case and don't anticipate it. generally speaking, right, the disaster response, there are broad flexibilities related to disaster response that are permitted when a disaster is declared and- and the examples i use about, like waiving of fees or making certain exceptions to standard procedures are: are the, the, the powers that are extended there, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the powers that are extended there, the. I anticipate that those that we've already done seem to be the limit of what we anticipate needing to do in this disaster. Again, it's the primary role at this point is in the documentation to state and federal agencies regarding the outcomes of the storm And the question I was going to ask right before. my second question is- and I know that we're still in the midst of it, my power just came on 10 minutes ago, But just in light of what happened, are there any plans of convening with Duquesne Light and the other stakeholders and kind of having a debrief and assessing and looking at lessons learned. You know, in the process of- I don't know if we have one on paper, but thinking about a resiliency plan for the region, given the reality of extreme weather events and climate change and how it's changing our region, We anticipate, if the restoration estimates hold true and the last folks who lost power in the storm are restored today, that's when we'll formally close the Emergency Operations Center, Which is the last one that we're going to close. So I'm just wondering if you have any plans to do that. Yeah, I think the first thing I would say is that we are going to continue to work with the disaster response and recovery portion of the effort and begin those conversations again. if everyone is restored today, as we expect to be the case, that would begin tomorrow. But yes, you're correct, Councilman, that that is the next step in this process And we've been planning for that. but I would say those conversations would begin in earnest as soon as we close down the sort of in the thick of it, if you will- phase of the response Which remains open and active until next year. So those last folks are restored. And my last question was- and again, like many of the other members of Council shout out to Emily, Yonan and Luis and the folks that are, who are our liaisons With Duquesne Light and I know, anecdotally, Emily, you know I mentioned this was the worst damage they have ever experienced. Does that job with the conversations that you've had? Absolutely. You know with the other folks that you talk a little bit about, you know the sheer magnitude you know of this storm compared to other storms and how you know it behooves us to in the future, you know, be more prepared, being that weather is changing. We're getting weather we've never seen in this region before. Right, I mean, this is this event is not identical but in many ways similar to last year's storm event in western North Carolina And eastern Tennessee or 2022's major flooding in eastern Kentucky. Right, I mean, these are weather patterns that are have not been typical to the Appalachian region in the past, that are happening with increased frequency as a result of climate change And that requires significant adaptation. Right, We will need to explore ways in which our infrastructure and our response posture need to be adjusted to this new reality. That's a there have been efforts underway in this direction. It is a focus of the ongoing work around the comprehensive plan, which also includes the development of a hazard mitigation plan, for exactly that reason. But I think the lessons learned from this firsthand example will be important inputs to those ongoing efforts. Thank you, Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Any further discussion? No, Okay, Thank you, Thank you, I do have a question. Council Round two. Yeah, Councilman, Councilperson Charlon, first round, And then we'll see if there's any other first round. All right, Thank you, Thank you for being here. So this brings up a really- and it's interesting, David, that you're here for this, because this is something you and I have talked about for years now. The scenario that happens all too often this time of year in my district has been happening for years where someone- be it on abandoned property, walkway property, whatever it might be- someone has a tree that is falling on someone else's or looking to fall on someone else's house And we do not have the authority to go do anything to help there. I remember calling, screaming, begging, crying to the URA: please help me, because we've got programs to help once the tree falls on someone's house. We do not have programs to help that tree from falling on someone's house, And it begs the question of: is there something we can do in terms of our emergency management powers, when this inevitably will happen next year- maybe not a storm of this magnitude, but eventually the soil will be softened, trees will start to lean and we'll have senior citizens calling the office saying: I can't pay for a new roof. And all I can say is that, well, when you do need a new roof, we've got programs for you, but we don't have the money. We don't have the money, We can't help you with that tree that's about to fall over here. And sometimes we can get the cowboy churches to go and do some illegal chainsaw work and go onto someone's property that no one would stop them from doing. But is a method like this something that we could possibly use to prevent those situations in the future? So, could we like, could we? is there a way to use our emergency powers for good? Well, I think we are already doing that, Not for the specific use case you're mentioning, which I do think is well worth considering, studying, analyzing, as part of the conversations that Deputy Mayor Pollack was just mentioning, that we're having, And I think that's something that we will immediately be pivoting to over the course of the next day or so, I think. that idea amongst many ideas that have been raised and, you know, please continue to let us know as those come up. I think all of those should be considered for that sort of postmortem on this storm and future planning for resiliency, whether it's around direct emergency management or, as Councilman Mosley brought up, sort of in general the needing to plan, for, you know, climate change and its realities, for you know the City of Pittsburgh and our region, Trees, specifically, are going to have to be a focal point of that analysis, both the immediate aftermath analysis of this event and incorporated into planning for these types of storm events into the future. right, We're rightfully very proud of our robust and growing tree canopy. You know they're not, you know they're not going to be the same as they were in the past. There are many cities that are not seeing the type of tree canopy growth that Pittsburgh has been fortunate to see over the last decade. But the health and condition of some of those trees clearly contributed to the amount of tree falls we had as a part of this storm. You're right, Councilmember, many of those trees are on private property or even in property with tangled title, which presents real, unfortunate and, I agree with you, very frustrating challenges as relates to property rights that are difficult to untangle. I think it is possible that there may be some relief available under the status of a declared emergency. I don't. we would need some legal guidance to further refine our understanding of that. But thank you for raising, bringing that sort of chronic issue into the context of this example, So we can certainly include that. Thank you, Thank you, I'll include that in the analysis. Yeah, I mean, it's something that I remember talking about in your office with you as a staffer, because I was the person you know talking to, you know the senior trying to talk them off the ledge here. You know, I do hope that this is the time that you do take that seriously. I do want to also offer this idea of this emergency declaration of we can enter private property. You know I have been on this very different issue But on this concept of emergency declaration because of our inability to manage trash, And is there a way that we could locally make that designation so that we could enter private property and clean up some of the constant issues that we have in our city with our with, you know, abandoned vacant properties that are have become dumping sites? I just, I do want to be clear that the even in our city, we have a lot of issues, We have a lot of problems, We have a lot of problems And I think that you know, even in our current situation, right, the limit of the intervention on private property that we're currently undertaking and we believe is what we're unable to do at this time, is to intervene on trees that you know when they were standing were on private property but are now impacting the public right of way, Things that would have been challenges under other circumstances. And I bring that to the table. I think that's a really important point And I bring that up to say that it would depend on the interpretation, I suppose, of the impact of something occurring on property outside of that property, Again, from a legal perspective, something that we would need more guidance on. I know we feel very comfortable and confident in the case for the types of work we're doing now to get the roadways and sidewalks reopened. and you know, assist Duquesne-Lightning, Thank you very much. know, assist duke and item restoring power. i don't know that that emergency authority would extend as far as you're asking. i'm not saying that it doesn't, i'm saying that's a a a question that i can't answer sitting here today. yeah, i would like to have clarification on what a disaster is. i think that our trash situation is a disaster by any. any of my residents would say that. so i i would like to understand what you mean by disaster, what, what we actually constitute as a disaster. obviously, this is, you know, i, you know, sometimes we, we learn our abilities of what we can do and what's possible through through emergencies, things like this that you know, that force us to to open up a different part of code. i hope this is something that we can use that for and we can, you know, figure out how to better serve residents. you know, in this time, i i do want to go to another issue, though, that i think we've all become aware of, and that is who was in charge of the emergency management coordination? the office of emergency management and homeland security is the primary entity within city government for managing emergency response, and who's in charge of that? chief daryl jones is the, in addition to being chief of the fire bureau, is the emergency management coordinator, and adam emil is the deputy emergency management coordinator within the office of emergency management. and where was chief jones during this time? in the initial. on the day of the the storm, he was outside of the city for training purposes. i don't recall off the top of my head where he was. adam emil, the deputy, as part of the deputy designation, led the initial opening of the emergency operations center and the coordination with outside agencies. when did he return? i, i don't recall at the top of my head is he here now? yes, has council been notified of this? i'm not aware. okay, i i am. we were not notified. okay, it continues to be a problem with notifying council, you know, with absentee letters. it's, you know, something i brought up last year continues to be an issue now in the. this is exactly why we have those policies in place. i was taking calls from, from lee schmidt, which you know. i thought that he was running coordination for us, which was, you know, could have been really helpful, but he was chief jones was was not here for that. well, i should make a distinction. right, like the, the office of emergency management is part of the department of public safety is part of the department of public safety, right, is it required to have a safety? so there was an hirekeeper who made these process the marathon to have a care exercise. So the entire staff there ultimately report to Director Schmidt, who was directly and intimately involved in every step of the emergency recovery effort and is one of the two appointed emergency managers in the declaration of emergency, which has a different definition or criteria for what that status means. When I say that the Office of Emergency Management is the primary agency in leading disaster response, they are the conveners. They run the emergency operations center meetings, They set that schedule, They are the focal point of communication between all of the agencies that participate in the EOC. So they're the clearinghouse of information, and that was a duty that Adam Amil conducted in this case in his capacity as deputy. Ultimately, the full authority for disaster response decision-making runs up from the emergency management coordinator, whether that be Chief Jones or his deputy, through the normal decision-making chain of command all the way up to the mayor. As to notification, I can inquire with the Department of Public Safety. They submit those on behalf of personnel in the Fire Bureau. Yeah, I don't know. I mean we've had this conversation that this is a problem with this administration not notifying us when people are out of town. This is exactly why You know, if an emergency happens like this, we need to know who is coordinating these efforts. I applaud Director Schmidt for being. you know, I've never had to reach out to Director Schmidt before for public works issues. He handled it. Oh, there he is. He handled it very well And I, you know, I appreciate those efforts. But as to, you know, we are, we're, we have somebody whose job it is to do this, who we pay to do this, and they're out of town and we don't know why or how, or who's in charge. So with that, those are my questions. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Councilwoman Kale Smith, followed by anyone else for first round before I move on to Sacramento. Thank you. I actually brought up the question about Chief Jones yesterday for the first time, wondering where he was through the emergency management, because the response has been: there's still people without power and there's still people without food and there's still people struggling, And it's not just because the city 9 1: 1 went down. We had no backup plan on our own. I don't know what their backup plan was. We had people calling the stations, the police stations, but in some cases there's not people at the police stations. So there's just a lot of communication that we've had. We've had a lot of questions. We've had calls from the police stations, We've had a lot of questions from the police stations, but we haven't been able to find them. We haven't been able to find them. But I think, you know, I think the most important thing is that we don't want to be a burden on the city. We don't want to be a burden on the city. But I think, you know, we issues and there's a lot of communication people in your office now, but the communication issues are with us and those people we deal directly with our. we deal directly with the public. but what i'm going to say is that that position that chief jones has now was put in place, same with omb under bill peduto, and i actually think that chief jones does an amazing job when he's here. he's extremely knowledgeable. so i don't want to, i don't want to say anything negative about chief jones. it's and i think that director schmidt has been very responsive, extremely responsive to all of us. but for me it's what. what is our plan for when emergencies happen? we have when natalia, when luke ravenstahl was in office, a 27 year old was in office as mayor. he was slammed over snowmageddon because he went away for his birthday for a couple days. that was snowmageddon. it was feet of snow, it was it. it was a larger disaster. all of the snowmageddon was a larger disaster, and the snowmageddon was a larger disaster and over the place. and yet people slammed him in the middle of the entire emergency, took you know, and then natalia rudyak at the time decided that she was going to put a plan in place for snow removal, which basically ended up being the exact plan that they were doing anyway, but now it's just a policy in pay on paper, but it has always been their practice. so my concern is, you know, if we're going to question somebody over- and i don't like the political part of this- i think when it comes to public safety, there should. there's no room for politics. i mean, we really need to come together and work together on this whole thing, because that the safety of the public should be our top priority. and so for me, my concern is: we have never had a position before that we paid. it was always the public safety director, and i just think that the communication needs to be better between when something happens, what's going, what's going to happen, how are we feeding our residents? i mean, it's my understanding. i sent a text to director schmidt saying that the salvation army was trying to reach the city, saying that they had a lot of resources, but nobody was responding back to them. he fortunately did make sure that that connection happened. and then there were, you know, people, obviously, with trees and wires and all those other things, and you know three tragedies and i mean thank god there wasn't more, because it really had the potential to be much more significant than what it was. and my concern is, i think, moving forward, we need to be more responsible for the safety of the public, safety of the city, and i think that's what we need to do and i know that's what i've been doing for a long time. i've been working for a long time and i'm working for a long time and i know that we need to work together on plans for any type of catastrophe that could happen, any time type of emergency. so you know we can't predict everything, but we basically know floods, trees, you know, lightning storms, terrorist attacks are all things that are possible. so those are things that i think that we need to, you know, sit down together and work collectively on, and i think it would be helpful if all of council worked with the administration and the, the director, on coming up with something, but also with the county, because when 9-1-1 went, i don't know what their back is, but i think it's really important. and then i think it's really important to work with the city and the. I don't know what their backup plan was. May I address that point specifically, Councilwoman? Yeah, And this was a clarification that was identified on Wednesday, the day after the storm, And it's important for the sake of clarity for the public and their understanding. The 911 center itself never went out of operation. That was widely believed to be true Tuesday night for a short, brief period of time. What happened is that the number of calls that were coming in overwhelmed the telecommunication infrastructure, So some folks were not able to get through. But it is important that folks understand that the 911 center remained operational, even on backup power, the entire time. That doesn't mean that some folks were not able to reach 911, And it was during that brief window of time that the Public Safety Department advised folks to call stations when we were hearing from residents that they couldn't get through at 911. But I just want to say for the sake of the county in their briefing to us the next day that the 911 center did not become disoperational. So I will say this: During Snowmageddon, I also volunteered for my husband and I both volunteered for 311. We went to the 311 center and we just started helping. You just wanted to pitch in As a city To help get us through a crisis, And so we went to the 311 center. But there's no center anymore. They're not working from home, And so I think what is the backup plan? if we do need a call center, Is there some place that we could tap into that maybe we can work with people and get people to help? I don't know all the details, So that's why I just want to have those conversations, But I also the email that went out. I'll be honest with you, My husband was going through heart problems that week And all kinds of stuff was going on, And so I thought, when I saw that text that said, or the tweet that said, to call- here's a link to call your zones for help- I panicked because I'm thinking he has a heart. I'm going to have to look up that number and do all this Like where I'm so used to calling 911. So I just think having some kind of like other plan, Calling the zones is the established backup response if 911 were to go down Or in a case like this. it's not down, But, as you know, we don't always have officers there Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right Right At the zone. We've heard that repeatedly throughout this past year. Yeah, I am aware of that concern And we would need the director or the police to answer this question. I believe that the procedure is, when we are making those notifications, to ensure that there is someone there to answer the phone, Even if that's not the case 100% of the time. I would like to just address your the larger context of your question, Because I think it does answer many of the items that you brought up. It was an initiative of Chief Jones' to begin work earlier this year on a hazard mitigation plan, which is a standard in the emergency response practitioners. The emergency managers across the country have what's called a hazard mitigation plan. that is intended to achieve exactly what you're saying, which is have standard response plans for these types of emergencies. Historically, the city of Pittsburgh has used the county's emergency management plan as our emergency management plan, The idea being we fold into their planning effort. This would be the first time that the city would establish its own plan, And so the questions you're asking are exactly the same questions that the Office of Emergency Management and the Planning Department are beginning to, and that's what we're trying to work on right now, And I think there is ample opportunity to, and it will require the engagement of all the stakeholders in finalizing those plans, But they've initiated that work earlier this year. It's in its preliminary stages right now. Okay, so I just wanna say to that I think that we should have had a plan in place. I believe we do have some plans somewhere that I remember people working on previously, So I'll try to track down something. I don't mean to suggest that there aren't a variety of plans, standard operating procedures, tourros or partnerships in that regard. I think it may be, and I think that we look at the organization withinWell, and it is kind of an êm- in the context of the pulling in all of the relevant agencies for coordination, The Emergency Operations Center met regularly- sometimes virtually because folks were in the field participating in the response, sometimes in person- at the Physical Emergency Operations Center on Railroad Street in the Strip District for the purposes of coordinating response activities That included not just city agencies but also county liaisons, representatives of Duquesne Light, representatives of the charitable or nonprofit human service agencies like. forgive me the example, I'm losing the example I meant to bring up, but there are numerous of those folks who participate. What I don't wanna do is belabor this point at the table right now, but I do wanna have this conversation because there's a lot that I can say and a lot I wanna say, and I'm not trying to make it political myself. so I would like to have that conversation at a different time, But I do think it's a conversation we all need to have, Absolutely, Thank you. Thank you, First round Council Member Gross. Thank you, I appreciate it. I'll keep it relatively brief. This declaration of emergency is for 30 days. I don't think anyone's actually it was read at the title of the bill, but I just wanted to remind people because we've- most of us were here during COVID and we voted on kind of repeating these declarations of emergency. So, just as a reminder for the public, it is only for 30 days and it allows things like renting equipment instead of waiting for a multi-week process that goes by presenting legislation and amending a budget and getting it back to you and all that kind of stuff So you could go out and rent equipment and things like that. It's also my recollection that early in COVID, in the previous administration, it was used to purchase questionable surveillance software And that I later, kind of a year later, when Council was asked to renew software, I said- I don't remember voting on this the first time And the answer was: oh well, we bought it under emergency services. So what I'm looking for in this administration is that there's a commitment that there is that when you get this permission- which you have now, because you have it under the first seven weeks for the American Declaration, or the first seven days- that you will not be buying services or things that are unrelated to the current emergency. You have that commitment, Thank you, thank you. I think we should also receive a report, click what was like a consolidated report of what was purchased. At this point we haven't utilized the emergency powers, to my knowledge, to purchase anything. We can certainly if there were incidental purchases of like personal protective equipment that I might not be aware of right now. like we can certainly compile that discoveries, Right, But my- Right Right- I mean after the staff- Right Right, Like personal protective equipment that I might not be aware of right now, like we can certainly compile that. But my- Right, Right, I mean after the staff-, after the 30, after the emergency. I think there should be a record of what was purchased so that it's just we can attach it to the public record and we can all see this was used for what it was intended for. I wholeheartedly concur with that assessment. My broader point is we do not at this time anticipate needing to use those procurement powers for anything in this emergency. Of course, that is subject to change as we learn more about conditions. For whatever it's used for, there should be a consolidated report and that we can review it so that we can see that it is constant with the intent. Sure, absolutely Perfect, that's it. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, I know Councilman Coghill was interested in a comment second round, and so in the interim I will just state that I've been very aware that Councilmember Warwick called for a post-agenda hearing mostly focused on Duquesne Light, And I was gonna wait until after we talked to kind of understand the scope of that. but I think what I'm gonna do at the end of this meeting is call for a hearing. that is, I think, a slightly different topic, which is discussing what we've all been discussing here today. after you've been able to go through the deep dive with Duquesne Light and understand the process and ways to improve, I think it would be helpful for us and for the public to hear the results of that discussion publicly, And so I think the hearing that I'd like to hold would be more, I think, more focused on a plan for future emergency responses, as climate disasters increase in frequency and possibly even again dependent on what is discussed at the Duquesne Light hearing- mitigation strategies like proactively and then in the moment what the response looks like. Happy to call for that today and then cancel it if that's actually not necessary, if that's actually gonna be included in the one that Councilwoman Warwick called for. So just wanted to state that A little stalling tactic until we move to second round while Councilman Coggle got back. Thank you, Madam Chair. So just I'll be brief. The emergency help that we get from Alabama, from wherever right, who pays for them? Do they get the funds? And if so, do we, Because I know we go out also right? That is coordinated by Duquesne Light. So Duquesne Light has what they call mutual aid agreements with other electric utilities. They send Duquesne Light crews to respond to disasters in other parts of the country under those agreements, And then those utilities also send crews here when we have a disaster- Perfect. So all of that is coordinated through Duquesne Light, The private utilities. we don't have to front a dime. Nobody has to deal with money going back and forth for their services, It's all done. I don't just for the sake of clarity. I don't know if there's cost sharing as part of those agreements between the utilities. It does not involve the city of the public. That's all matters to me. Somebody's paying them, you know, as long as everybody's compensated in whatever way. I'm sure they have it figured out, Not our responsibility, Got it Okay. so the other thing was- and I was talking to Director Schmidt, which thank you, Director, for keeping me well informed as to how things unfolded and you know power lines and outages and stuff like that. I don't want to have to call you up here because I don't think you need to. But one concern I had. I had many parts of the city of my neighborhoods were severed off right, Couldn't get in with an automobile, couldn't get out. There's only one road in one road out. big trees this big around that. we couldn't move, we couldn't touch because we were waiting for Duquesne Light, who were overwhelmed, and you know the story goes on. So I did think and I did work, I did a lot of work on the city but I didn't have a story about. because I was asked and I thought I don't know, to be honest with you, Like what if somebody took a cardiac arrest a tenth of a mile down from where that tree came down across the road right Now? Director Schmidt and I talked about this and I was. my nerves were put to ease just by talking to him and it's kind of what I assumed. And you mentioned our firefighters earlier. Well, if we needed to get six firefighters there with a stretcher, we'll get in and we'll get out and we'll get them out And the help that they need. But I didn't know if we had a broader, you know more like a safety plan, Like is there a like? do we have to do it on the whim or is there a strategic plan in place where it's like- and I keep using firefighters just because there's such able-bodied force that we have in this situation crawling over, going through power lines and trying to get somebody out of a bad situation, I don't know who else we would have to do such a thing, And my question is: do we have a plan- and I've heard other members talking about getting a safety plan in place- I'd rather I'd like to have something black and white that says, yes, firefighters will be called in or a certain whoever, it might be Army National Guard, I don't know. Yeah, What you describe is the plan right. So that's the reason that you know, or that's one of the many reasons, that firefighters dispatch to those types of calls Right On a daily basis, Right On a routine basis. And you're correct: In an instance where you know the roadway isn't accessible, in circumstances like these, the emergency service members- fire, EMS, police- will coordinate to evacuate someone safely, even from a place where they can't get to by a vehicle. We also documented instances where that was the case either through visual observation from any member of the city's staff. you know, DPW, DOME, fire EMS police were observing those things and reporting them in. They were then communicated to Duquesne Light through the Emergency Operations Center to be prioritized for inspection by them to get the power lines addressed so that we could then cut up the trees Right. So there is a standard procedure and it is exactly what you said. Good, We know, we identify and know where these places are Right, And so we know what we'll need to respond to them until we can get them cleared, And then we also put them at the top of the priority list for clearance. Yep, As good as our public safety is- I figured there was, but I couldn't speak exactly to it. Sure, So it would be good if I had something like: yeah, so and so gets called first, and then if they're not available or they're overwhelmed, then we bring in the forces from here. just something more. eventually, you know, in a document, I guess, type thing that we could actually speak to. Yeah, other than PLI, you know which, you put that to rest which, thank you, you know they can. you know they have three-day grace period, I guess, to apply for such permits so they don't have to wait for our process. And so, other than that was the actual, again, having people severed off, and whether it's not just cardiac arrest or emergency or that situation, it's getting them water or whatever it is, you know. so, Okay, I mean, it's obviously there's nothing. well, a natural disaster, right? We can't control which trees fall and you know, the ideal solution would not to be to not have any dead end streets. but those were decisions made a long time ago, Right? So the best we can do in those circumstances is identify those barriers quickly and eliminate them quickly, Right, And Pittsburgh's such a great town, like everybody just pitches in. the neighbors pitch in, Absolutely. You know everybody's kind of all hands on deck. at least in my neighborhoods It's everybody's out to help each other. so, Okay, That's it for me, Madam Chair. All in all, I will say: you know, I think, you know, I think our public works, our public safety, did a great job and as good a job as can be expected under those circumstances, and the same with Duquesne Light as well. I would say They're again getting the brunt of the. they're getting beat up today by many different media outlets, but all in all, I really feel like they did as good a job as they could under this. They had a great answer. They really did, They really did, And I would, I will say, on behalf of the administration and just our efforts, being part of the coordination, I mean the entire, you know, team, including public safety, public works. they were very helpful and forthcoming in the coordination efforts. I could tell. I could tell. I watched the interviews and things. yeah, So I could tell they were fully engaged and, you know, trying to just help out as best they could. So thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you Any further for second round: Seeing none. all those in favor of bill of supplemental bill 18. 2. please indicate by saying aye, Aye. Affirmative recommendation. Thank you very much.",Pittsburgh City Council extends emergency declaration for 30 days following April 29 storm that caused widespread power outages and tree damage.,"**Pittsburgh City Council Extends Emergency Declaration for April 29 Storm**

• **Council approved extending the city's emergency declaration for 30 days** (until May 30, 2025) following the severe thunderstorm on April 29 that caused widespread damage and power outages

• **The storm caused major damage across the city**, with officials calling it the worst damage Duquesne Light has ever experienced, leading to three deaths and leaving thousands without power for over a week

• **Emergency powers allow the city to work faster** by waiving normal contracting rules and letting workers access private property more quickly to remove downed trees that block roads or create safety hazards

• **The main purpose now is documenting costs** for potential state and federal disaster aid from FEMA, rather than using special emergency spending powers

• **About 6,000 customers were still without power** as of the meeting, but Duquesne Light expected to restore service to everyone by that evening

• **Free yard waste drop-off was provided** to residents cleaning up storm debris, and Team Rubicon (a volunteer disaster response group) is helping residents remove trees on private property through the 211 helpline

• **The city's emergency management coordinator, Fire Chief Daryl Jones, was out of town** during the initial storm response for training, with his deputy Adam Emil leading the emergency operations center

• **Council members called for better emergency planning** and communication, including developing the city's own disaster response plan rather than relying only on the county's plan

• **Utility crews came from multiple states** including Alabama, Erie, and Cleveland to help restore power, coordinated through mutual aid agreements between electric companies"

These employees are receiving already their new wages and rates, but this is more of the back end accounting to make sure that it reflects appropriately, And so we have what amount in the budget and what amount are we transferring? So we set aside 1. 5 million. Some of that, most of that is in HR, Some of that is in each of the individual departments And we are only moving for 2025, which is the legally appropriated year- 650,000. So we, you know, across the five years. all three agreements came in within what we set aside for bargaining. You know some of them will be a little bit more than that amount in the last years. So the monies will lapse into the fund balance this year And allow us to recapture them for future budget years. And was there? I mean it's not incredibly relevant here, but there were a couple of different switches from representation from one union to another. Would you like to elaborate there? just to inform us? Sure, So the crossing guards were formally represented by SEIU 192B And then in the past year they have switched their representation. They have changed their representation of their own accord to SEIU 668. That did not really impact the day-to-day workings of our employees doing the crossing guard job, But in terms of who we worked with, you know the SEIU business manager. that did change the negotiation parties. Thank you, And thank you for the full explanation. I wanted to ask these questions for the purposes of sort of getting it out there for other council members to hear Any further discussion. Councilwoman Gross. Thank you, Director. You may or may not be the right person to ask this question, but recently we had our crossing guards at the table for post-agenda, I think, And for Vision Zero- thank you, Councilman, for Vision Zero post-agenda- And they told us that they and the administration have unlocked a problem that has been existing since I started on council more than 10 years ago. At that time, We hadn't hired new crossing guards in 2014 for a very long time And we were desperately in need of one. in front of Arsenal K-5 and middle school at Butler and 40th, where five-year-olds were trying to get to school And there was no crossing And the traffic patterns were increasing and changing. It was dangerous And people were volunteering. It was just a mess. And so we got, you know, one new crossing guard And we got a crossing guard assigned there. But every kind of subsequent request, it would be like, well, we're just going to have to do this. We're desperate for people who want to be crossing guards. But then when I found people, or other members found people who wanted to be crossing guards, it didn't work out because they couldn't be assigned in a time slot and in a location that was convenient for them, And so we just heard that this has been, through this contract negotiation, unlocked. Can you speak to that? Yes, Yes, Yes, Thank you, Please. So that's a great thing to bring up And I think what we've worked through in this contract is we've come to terms for a new title of the neighborhood guard- neighborhood crossing guard- And the way we've worked this out. if a full time guard- I mean all of the postings are bid, right, They are bid locations And what you're referring to is occasionally you would have spots where someone hasn't bid on it and there's not enough people to fill the spots. So what we have worked through now is if there is a space where a full time guard has not bid on a crossing, Individuals, for that matter, aren't allowed to enter. Right, Right, Okay, Okay, individuals from within a neighborhood, from a hyper-local space, even if they're eligible for city employment, apply, get through. they're able to apply for a specific location And they could kind of work that location until someone fully bids on it or something else comes up. But it's much more of a. it's a limited role, but it is meant to fill that need. The supervisor, Donna McManus, was at City in the Streets last night and on her way out she stopped me and said she has been very successful with recruiting very recently and she's really excited about getting this out there to help people come in. like you said, This is wonderful. So I'm gonna go back and look to all of the locations that really, really needed a crossing guard and there was someone in the neighborhood who was willing to do it, but only at that spot or nearby that spot because, again, maybe they have kids in the school system, maybe they have other people that they are caregivers for, maybe they're retired and just don't or don't have their own car right. So I had people who wanted to be crossing guards but could not get across the city to some other strange assigned location that to them they hadn't anticipated. So this is fantastic, like transformative right For safety for everyone who needs time and care crossing the streets and for our busy intersections that are very frequently in my district, close to things like schools, right Or even our parks. This is tremendous news. so thank you so much. Appreciate it, Of course. Councilwoman Kale-Smith, Thank you. I just real briefly. first I wanna thank Donna McManus. She's amazing with the crossing guards. I've known her for about 30 years. I know she lives in Councilman Coghill's district and they do a lot of work together. So I wanna thank her for her work and all the crossing guards and the city employees that do so much with so little, But I wanna thank them all for their work And I would be willing to pay them whatever we could. I'm concerned about do we get any money from the school district for crossing guards? They used to pay for them, right, For their day-to-day regular shifts. I'm not aware of any monies coming from the school district. No, But at one point didn't they pay them And then we just took it over one year and then we just, Yeah, took it over from every year after, I think Since I've been- I mean in 10 years I've been here- Yeah, it was before you were here. we have not, so I'd have to dig in further than that. Yeah, But I mean it's a good point. It was before you were here, but there was some kind of partnership that we helped work with the school district, And I can look back on my files too. but I'm just wondering if the school district does anything to, especially because we're starting to keep places open later- rec centers, pools, different things- and we have crossing guards at some of those locations still, and we have some of those places that are open for the summer. so I'm wondering if there's any help with the school district, especially because they have summer programs too. now, Right, So could we just look into that? We can look into it, Troy. Okay, thank you. The school district and also the private schools, charter schools, you know there's a lot of other types of schools that we could think about too. You know, at my crossing in particular, it's not just Pittsburgh Public, but there's a whole wide range that Jeff crosses and he does a great job every day And I feel like our crossing guards can always use funding. but all our employees- I mean we just you know we're not, you know we're not, we're not paying our employees, We're not paying our employees, We're not paying our employees. But I think Pittsburgh is doing better and better at paying our employees. I really do, Although they may not feel that, but I do think that we are doing better. Not that we couldn't do even better, but I just was looking, as I was looking up, to see if we, when we stopped paying, when the school district stopped paying for the crossing guards, I saw that we are above average in paying our guards on a national level, like by 48%. So I mean, I think it may not seem like we're doing enough, but sometimes I guess, when you come back, I guess when you compare it to other national levels, we're doing pretty good, Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Coghill. Thank you, Madam Chair. Patrick, welcome, Yes, That's interesting, You know, I didn't realize that. So 668 is allowing the city to go into a kind of like a separate contract with somebody If there's no bidder on a certain corner, busy corner. 668 is we're going into contract with a private citizen. No, these would be city employees. They would have to move through you know, the regular HR checks, application PGH jobs. But they wouldn't be 668, They know they would be Okay. They would just be a different job title classification because of it's just narrowed to one certain. Correct, That's correct. Yeah, Good question. No, that's that's interesting, That's that's great. And Donna says recruitment's good. Yeah, that's wonderful. Okay, I just want clarification. Thanks, Thank you. Any further discussion Seeing none? All those in favor of Bill 1784, please indicate by saying aye, Aye, Aye, Thank you, I'm going to abstain today, just to look at the information. One more thing: Same pay scale For each of these different groups. No, I mean, each one is negotiated separately, based on their own needs, their own kind of wants for the next five years. I'll say these are all five year terms, Gotcha, And they're all kind of moving Gotcha, Gotcha, And they're all moving based on their own industries and fields. Okay, Okay, Sorry. Yeah, I have a quick question, as I'm like- because I know someone who would be great for this- For the posting, is it just the crossing Like if you're looking for a job? is it just crossing guard? So the title would be a different job description, a neighborhood crossing guard, as opposed to just the regular crossing guard, So it would be its own separate posting. I don't believe it's up yet. We have to work through the job description and the forms, But it should be soon. But if someone is applying for the crossing guard and it's like not a fit, for whatever reason, will they be directed? I don't want to lose someone because they applied to the wrong. you know what I mean. Yes, HR can certainly help. Okay, Can we make sure, Because I know that, you know? I mean, I know that people think crossing guard and they're going to apply for crossing guard and they're just even searching on the list. right, We'll make sure, Okay, Thank you. Congratulations on finalizing All of the agreements as well. Thank you, We have, if I may, we have three more- that we are starting up for our next round that move into 2026. Thank you","**Section of meeting agenda:**

**Section of meeting transcript:**
bill 1784. bill 1784 resolution authorizing the authorizing interdepartmental transfers in the amount of six hundred forty seven thousand two hundred twenty eight dollars and sixty three cents from the departmental level of the departmental services and civil service to the department of public safety, bureau of administration, the Department of Public Works, Bureau of Operations, Bureau of Environmental Services and Bureau of facilities, the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure. these budget neutral transfers are necessary to properly align funding associated with the recent service employees International Union. 668, an American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. 2037 contract ratifications. second. second: I'd like to ask chief Cornell to come up and elaborate on this a little bit. he was very helpful in informing me a little bit about the details of this and, to the extent possible, I'd like for him to share that with the rest of Council as well. sure, thank you, Patrick Cornell, chief financial officer. this bill moves monies already budgeted, already council approved dollars within the Department of Human Resources and civil service to the various departments where employees who are part of three different labor groups work. we recently finished and came to successful terms with SCI you 668. they now represent two different groups: our recreation and park ranger employees and also our crossing guards would larger beibe of year last year of what we are doing is, now that we have come to terms terms, making sure that the monies that are available are where they need to be, to hit in the right places for payroll in the financial system. These employees are receiving already their new wages and rates, but this is more of the back end accounting to make sure that it reflects appropriately, And so we have what amount in the budget and what amount are we transferring? So we set aside 1. 5 million. Some of that, most of that is in HR, Some of that is in each of the individual departments And we are only moving for 2025, which is the legally appropriated year- 650,000. So we, you know, across the five years. all three agreements came in within what we set aside for bargaining. You know some of them will be a little bit more than that amount in the last years. So the monies will lapse into the fund balance this year And allow us to recapture them for future budget years. And was there? I mean it's not incredibly relevant here, but there were a couple of different switches from representation from one union to another. Would you like to elaborate there? just to inform us? Sure, So the crossing guards were formally represented by SEIU 192B And then in the past year they have switched their representation. They have changed their representation of their own accord to SEIU 668. That did not really impact the day-to-day workings of our employees doing the crossing guard job, But in terms of who we worked with, you know the SEIU business manager. that did change the negotiation parties. Thank you, And thank you for the full explanation. I wanted to ask these questions for the purposes of sort of getting it out there for other council members to hear Any further discussion. Councilwoman Gross. Thank you, Director. You may or may not be the right person to ask this question, but recently we had our crossing guards at the table for post-agenda, I think, And for Vision Zero- thank you, Councilman, for Vision Zero post-agenda- And they told us that they and the administration have unlocked a problem that has been existing since I started on council more than 10 years ago. At that time, We hadn't hired new crossing guards in 2014 for a very long time And we were desperately in need of one. in front of Arsenal K-5 and middle school at Butler and 40th, where five-year-olds were trying to get to school And there was no crossing And the traffic patterns were increasing and changing. It was dangerous And people were volunteering. It was just a mess. And so we got, you know, one new crossing guard And we got a crossing guard assigned there. But every kind of subsequent request, it would be like, well, we're just going to have to do this. We're desperate for people who want to be crossing guards. But then when I found people, or other members found people who wanted to be crossing guards, it didn't work out because they couldn't be assigned in a time slot and in a location that was convenient for them, And so we just heard that this has been, through this contract negotiation, unlocked. Can you speak to that? Yes, Yes, Yes, Thank you, Please. So that's a great thing to bring up And I think what we've worked through in this contract is we've come to terms for a new title of the neighborhood guard- neighborhood crossing guard- And the way we've worked this out. if a full time guard- I mean all of the postings are bid, right, They are bid locations And what you're referring to is occasionally you would have spots where someone hasn't bid on it and there's not enough people to fill the spots. So what we have worked through now is if there is a space where a full time guard has not bid on a crossing, Individuals, for that matter, aren't allowed to enter. Right, Right, Okay, Okay, individuals from within a neighborhood, from a hyper-local space, even if they're eligible for city employment, apply, get through. they're able to apply for a specific location And they could kind of work that location until someone fully bids on it or something else comes up. But it's much more of a. it's a limited role, but it is meant to fill that need. The supervisor, Donna McManus, was at City in the Streets last night and on her way out she stopped me and said she has been very successful with recruiting very recently and she's really excited about getting this out there to help people come in. like you said, This is wonderful. So I'm gonna go back and look to all of the locations that really, really needed a crossing guard and there was someone in the neighborhood who was willing to do it, but only at that spot or nearby that spot because, again, maybe they have kids in the school system, maybe they have other people that they are caregivers for, maybe they're retired and just don't or don't have their own car right. So I had people who wanted to be crossing guards but could not get across the city to some other strange assigned location that to them they hadn't anticipated. So this is fantastic, like transformative right For safety for everyone who needs time and care crossing the streets and for our busy intersections that are very frequently in my district, close to things like schools, right Or even our parks. This is tremendous news. so thank you so much. Appreciate it, Of course. Councilwoman Kale-Smith, Thank you. I just real briefly. first I wanna thank Donna McManus. She's amazing with the crossing guards. I've known her for about 30 years. I know she lives in Councilman Coghill's district and they do a lot of work together. So I wanna thank her for her work and all the crossing guards and the city employees that do so much with so little, But I wanna thank them all for their work And I would be willing to pay them whatever we could. I'm concerned about do we get any money from the school district for crossing guards? They used to pay for them, right, For their day-to-day regular shifts. I'm not aware of any monies coming from the school district. No, But at one point didn't they pay them And then we just took it over one year and then we just, Yeah, took it over from every year after, I think Since I've been- I mean in 10 years I've been here- Yeah, it was before you were here. we have not, so I'd have to dig in further than that. Yeah, But I mean it's a good point. It was before you were here, but there was some kind of partnership that we helped work with the school district, And I can look back on my files too. but I'm just wondering if the school district does anything to, especially because we're starting to keep places open later- rec centers, pools, different things- and we have crossing guards at some of those locations still, and we have some of those places that are open for the summer. so I'm wondering if there's any help with the school district, especially because they have summer programs too. now, Right, So could we just look into that? We can look into it, Troy. Okay, thank you. The school district and also the private schools, charter schools, you know there's a lot of other types of schools that we could think about too. You know, at my crossing in particular, it's not just Pittsburgh Public, but there's a whole wide range that Jeff crosses and he does a great job every day And I feel like our crossing guards can always use funding. but all our employees- I mean we just you know we're not, you know we're not, we're not paying our employees, We're not paying our employees, We're not paying our employees. But I think Pittsburgh is doing better and better at paying our employees. I really do, Although they may not feel that, but I do think that we are doing better. Not that we couldn't do even better, but I just was looking, as I was looking up, to see if we, when we stopped paying, when the school district stopped paying for the crossing guards, I saw that we are above average in paying our guards on a national level, like by 48%. So I mean, I think it may not seem like we're doing enough, but sometimes I guess, when you come back, I guess when you compare it to other national levels, we're doing pretty good, Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Coghill. Thank you, Madam Chair. Patrick, welcome, Yes, That's interesting, You know, I didn't realize that. So 668 is allowing the city to go into a kind of like a separate contract with somebody If there's no bidder on a certain corner, busy corner. 668 is we're going into contract with a private citizen. No, these would be city employees. They would have to move through you know, the regular HR checks, application PGH jobs. But they wouldn't be 668, They know they would be Okay. They would just be a different job title classification because of it's just narrowed to one certain. Correct, That's correct. Yeah, Good question. No, that's that's interesting, That's that's great. And Donna says recruitment's good. Yeah, that's wonderful. Okay, I just want clarification. Thanks, Thank you. Any further discussion Seeing none? All those in favor of Bill 1784, please indicate by saying aye, Aye, Aye, Thank you, I'm going to abstain today, just to look at the information. One more thing: Same pay scale For each of these different groups. No, I mean, each one is negotiated separately, based on their own needs, their own kind of wants for the next five years. I'll say these are all five year terms, Gotcha, And they're all kind of moving Gotcha, Gotcha, And they're all moving based on their own industries and fields. Okay, Okay, Sorry. Yeah, I have a quick question, as I'm like- because I know someone who would be great for this- For the posting, is it just the crossing Like if you're looking for a job? is it just crossing guard? So the title would be a different job description, a neighborhood crossing guard, as opposed to just the regular crossing guard, So it would be its own separate posting. I don't believe it's up yet. We have to work through the job description and the forms, But it should be soon. But if someone is applying for the crossing guard and it's like not a fit, for whatever reason, will they be directed? I don't want to lose someone because they applied to the wrong. you know what I mean. Yes, HR can certainly help. Okay, Can we make sure, Because I know that, you know? I mean, I know that people think crossing guard and they're going to apply for crossing guard and they're just even searching on the list. right, We'll make sure, Okay, Thank you. Congratulations on finalizing All of the agreements as well. Thank you, We have, if I may, we have three more- that we are starting up for our next round that move into 2026. Thank you","Pittsburgh City Council approves moving $647,228 between city departments to pay for new union contracts for crossing guards, park workers, and other city employees.","**Pittsburgh City Council Approves $647,228 Budget Transfer for Union Contract Payments**

• City Council approved moving $647,228 from the Human Resources department to six other city departments to cover new union contract costs

• The money will pay for wage increases for crossing guards, park workers, and other city employees in two unions: SEIU 668 and AFSCME 2037

• This is a ""budget neutral"" transfer - no new money is being spent, just moving existing funds to the right departments for payroll

• The city had set aside $1.5 million total for union contract negotiations, but only needs to move $650,000 this year

• All three union agreements came in under the budgeted amount, with leftover money going back to the city's fund balance for future years

• Crossing guards switched from being represented by SEIU 192B to SEIU 668, but this didn't affect their daily work

• The new contracts created a ""neighborhood crossing guard"" position that allows local residents to work at specific intersections in their neighborhoods

• This solves a long-standing problem where the city couldn't fill crossing guard positions because people couldn't travel across the city to work at assigned locations

• All union contracts are five-year agreements, with employees already receiving their new wages while the city handles the accounting paperwork

• Pittsburgh pays crossing guards 48% above the national average, according to council discussion"

  Body
The Council of the City of Pittsburgh ordains as follows:
  Section 1. The Pittsburgh Code of Ordinances, Title Nine: Zoning Code, Article III: Overlay Zoning Districts, Chapter 907: Development Overlay Districts, is hereby amended at Section 907.04: IZ-O, Inclusionary Housing Overlay District, as follows:
  907.04. - IZ-O, Inclusionary Housing Overlay District.
  907.04.A                     IZ-O, Inclusionary Housing Overlay District
  [907.04.A.1]                     General Boundaries
[The specific boundaries of the Inclusionary Housing Planning Overlay District (IZ-O) are mapped as a supplement to this Section and as an amendment to the City's Zoning District Map, in accordance with Section 902.03.]
  907.04.A.1[2]                     Need for [Zoning Overlay] Inclusionary Housing
[The] Inclusionary Housing [Planning Overlay District] is necessary to increase the production of affordable housing to meet existing and anticipated housing and employment needs and to provide a diverse range of housing choices within the [District boundaries] City of Pittsburgh. The [updated] zoning will provide adequate balances by ensuring that the neighborhoods can elect to encourage the creation of inclusionary housing within their boundaries and continue to offer new housing units at a variety of price points.
  907.04.A.2[3]                     Purpose and Intent
The intent of the Inclusionary Housing [Planning Overlay District] provisions is to promote the public health and welfare by empowering neighborhoods to encourage and evaluate the creation of inclusionary housing within their boundaries, thereby increasing the supply of affordable housing for a range of family sizes and promoting economic integration [within the District boundaries] throughout the City. [Due to the unique circumstances involved with development within this area, the existing zoning mechanisms do not serve to carry out the purpose and intent of Chapter 901 (General Provisions) and all provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, t]The intent of the Inclusionary Housing provisions [IZ-O] is to encourage quality, economically-balanced, and neighborhood-appropriate development by:
a)                     Leveraging development pressure by connecting the production of affordable housing with the current market production of housing units;
b)                     Encouraging diverse and balanced housing available for households of all income levels and ensuring that when developing the limited supply of developable land, housing opportunities for persons of variety of income levels are provided; and
c)                     [Utilizing sites in IZ-O as opportunities to build mixed income developments. Because remaining land appropriate for residential development within in the IZ-O is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be developed into housing units affordable to low and moderate-income people.] Empowering neighborhoods to participate in the process of permitting creation of inclusionary housing within their boundaries.

  907.04.A.4                     Adoption
Neighborhoods, as designated by the Department of City Planning and identified on the City Zoning Map, may elect to adopt inclusionary zoning within their boundaries to encourage the creation of housing subject to the standards of this Section.
  When promulgating rules and procedures for the adoption of inclusionary zoning by neighborhoods, the Department of City Planning must require the performance of a Housing Needs Assessment for the neighborhood which is requesting to be included in the inclusionary zoning district. The Council of the City of Pittsburgh, based on recommendation from the Planning Commission, must ratify the applying neighborhood’s adoption of inclusionary zoning within its boundaries and must hold public hearings in the manner prescribed for any amendment to the City Zoning Code and Map.
  Once a neighborhood elects to adopt inclusionary zoning within its boundaries, the Department of Cit Planning must perform a Housing Needs Assessment every five years from the date of adoption. The performance of this assessment will occur in conformity with the same rules and procedures, including requirements for public hearing, promulgated by the Department for the initial adoption of inclusionary zoning in the affected neighborhood. The purpose of performing this assessment is to determine the amount of affordable housing created by the adoption of this zoning within the neighborhood’s boundaries and consequent need for such housing in this neighborhood.
  Housing developments in districts of the City of Pittsburgh subject to any City specialized tax abatement program (i.e., a targeted abatement program that is unique to a particular neighborhood or City area, as opposed to being available City-wide as authorized by the Local Economic Revitalization Tax Assistance Act or Transit Revitalization Investment District) are exempt from the standards of this Section.
  Any projects being built outside of inclusionary zoning neighborhoods may elect to follow the standards, funding, and development bonuses set forth in this Section at their discretion.

  Body
The Council of the City of Pittsburgh ordains as follows:
  Section 1. The Pittsburgh Code of Ordinances, Title Nine: Zoning Code, Article III: Overlay Zoning Districts, Chapter 907: Development Overlay Districts, is hereby amended at Section 907.04: IZ-O, Inclusionary Housing Overlay District, as follows:
  907.04. - IZ-O, Inclusionary Housing Overlay District.
  907.04.A                     IZ-O, Inclusionary Housing Overlay District
  [907.04.A.1]                     General Boundaries
[The specific boundaries of the Inclusionary Housing Planning Overlay District (IZ-O) are mapped as a supplement to this Section and as an amendment to the City's Zoning District Map, in accordance with Section 902.03.]
  907.04.A.1[2]                     Need for [Zoning Overlay] Inclusionary Housing
[The] Inclusionary Housing [Planning Overlay District] is necessary to increase the production of affordable housing to meet existing and anticipated housing and employment needs and to provide a diverse range of housing choices within the [District boundaries] City of Pittsburgh. The [updated] zoning will provide adequate balances by ensuring that the neighborhoods can elect to encourage the creation of inclusionary housing within their boundaries and continue to offer new housing units at a variety of price points.
  907.04.A.2[3]                     Purpose and Intent
The intent of the Inclusionary Housing [Planning Overlay District] provisions is to promote the public health and welfare by empowering neighborhoods to encourage and evaluate the creation of inclusionary housing within their boundaries, thereby increasing the supply of affordable housing for a range of family sizes and promoting economic integration [within the District boundaries] throughout the City. [Due to the unique circumstances involved with development within this area, the existing zoning mechanisms do not serve to carry out the purpose and intent of Chapter 901 (General Provisions) and all provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, t]The intent of the Inclusionary Housing provisions [IZ-O] is to encourage quality, economically-balanced, and neighborhood-appropriate development by:
a)                     Leveraging development pressure by connecting the production of affordable housing with the current market production of housing units;
b)                     Encouraging diverse and balanced housing available for households of all income levels and ensuring that when developing the limited supply of developable land, housing opportunities for persons of variety of income levels are provided; and
c)                     [Utilizing sites in IZ-O as opportunities to build mixed income developments. Because remaining land appropriate for residential development within in the IZ-O is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be developed into housing units affordable to low and moderate-income people.] Empowering neighborhoods to participate in the process of permitting creation of inclusionary housing within their boundaries.

  907.04.A.4                     Adoption
Neighborhoods, as designated by the Department of City Planning and identified on the City Zoning Map, may elect to adopt inclusionary zoning within their boundaries to encourage the creation of housing subject to the standards of this Section.
  When promulgating rules and procedures for the adoption of inclusionary zoning by neighborhoods, the Department of City Planning must require the performance of a Housing Needs Assessment for the neighborhood which is requesting to be included in the inclusionary zoning district. The Council of the City of Pittsburgh, based on recommendation from the Planning Commission, must ratify the applying neighborhood’s adoption of inclusionary zoning within its boundaries and must hold public hearings in the manner prescribed for any amendment to the City Zoning Code and Map.
  Once a neighborhood elects to adopt inclusionary zoning within its boundaries, the Department of Cit Planning must perform a Housing Needs Assessment every five years from the date of adoption. The performance of this assessment will occur in conformity with the same rules and procedures, including requirements for public hearing, promulgated by the Department for the initial adoption of inclusionary zoning in the affected neighborhood. The purpose of performing this assessment is to determine the amount of affordable housing created by the adoption of this zoning within the neighborhood’s boundaries and consequent need for such housing in this neighborhood.
  Housing developments in districts of the City of Pittsburgh subject to any City specialized tax abatement program (i.e., a targeted abatement program that is unique to a particular neighborhood or City area, as opposed to being available City-wide as authorized by the Local Economic Revitalization Tax Assistance Act or Transit Revitalization Investment District) are exempt from the standards of this Section.
  Any projects being built outside of inclusionary zoning neighborhoods may elect to follow the standards, funding, and development bonuses set forth in this Section at their discretion.

Seeing no discussion, all those in favor of holding Bill 1284 for a cablecast public hearing please indicate by saying aye, Aye, Opposed Aye.",Pittsburgh City Council voted to hold a major zoning overhaul for public hearing that would let neighborhoods choose to require affordable housing in new developments of 20 or more units.,"• Pittsburgh City Council voted to hold Bill 1284 for a public hearing, which would create a major change to the city's zoning rules for affordable housing

• The bill would let neighborhoods choose whether to require affordable housing in new developments of 20 or more units, rather than applying the same rules citywide

• Under the proposed rules, developers would need to include three types of affordable units in their projects:
  - 10% for very low-income households (earning 50% or less of area median income)
  - 15% for low-income households (earning 51-80% of area median income) 
  - 20% for workforce households (earning 81-99% of area median income)

• The affordable units would need to stay affordable for 20 years and be spread throughout buildings, not concentrated in one area

• Developers could build the affordable units off-site within half a mile of their main project, or pay a fee of up to $50,000 per required unit instead

• The city would help fund the affordable housing through existing programs and agencies

• Developers who follow the rules would get bonuses like being able to build taller buildings and faster approval processes

• The bill also makes changes to downtown zoning rules and environmental standards for development projects

• Council Member Charland sponsored the bill, which has already received a recommendation from the Planning Commission"

I haven't heard about it much in the past year. Is it because of the technology or is it because I'll let Sylvia explain what's been going on? Oh yeah, it absolutely still has been happening. It does. What happens is when folks are hacked while the investigations are going on, they are reluctant to discuss it because of the ongoing investigation. So the hacks are still happening pretty much at the same rate, And the biggest vector is email and people clicking And so being able to try to get ahead of that human risk management type of thing, that's a big challenge. It's funny you say that because when we were forced to be online through COVID, I hit something and my chief of staff was like you shouldn't have hit that And I'm like what do you mean? I said that was going to blow up the whole system. I really did, But yeah, so I fell victim to whatever that was. We survived. Have we been a target? Have we been hacked? We are always a target History do you know of? We are always a target. There have been incidents. There are always going to be those kind of things when people click. So what you described, It's dangerous. putting me on the other end of the fire, We would consider that to be an incident. So things like that, Maybe you should like sequester me, I think, in doing these online meetings, if we're ever forced into them again. you know, Done So, okay. so this is an ongoing issue. Again, I used to hear about it all the time You're telling me people were just quiet about it because I guess they're compromising people's personal information, and who wants to talk about that? if you're a bank or a city government or You know? or disclosure's slow, Right, but it continues to happen. We have to continue to fight it. We're going to continue to dump money. It's technology, you know. I guess Everything's expensive, Whether it's buying it, the software or protecting it. right, You have a police chief and a great force that's protecting the people and our physical assets. And here is our police chief for online in the digital world. That's what we're talking about. Yeah, right, right, It is our security force. One of you, just with money. that's all right. So, okay, that's good. I just wanted kind of a better understanding. I'll support today Again. I always say technology is expensive. It's kind of too expensive for my taste, but I still use 3x5 index cards. so More power to you, Yeah, Thank you. Thank you Any further for first round? No, I'll just before we move to second round. So what I'm hearing is this is like when I think of: like your doctor, your doctor always has to stay up to the latest advances in medicine. They maybe go to ongoing education to learn that, but if they're so overwhelmed that they don't have the time to do that, this would be like the equivalent of them hiring someone to do that research for them to make sure that they're up on the current medicine. This is our version of that, but for Like and staying up on all of the different, not just trends, but all of the trends that are happening in the world. So I mean, I think that's a really good metaphor. I think that's a really good metaphor. I think that's a really good metaphor. I think that's a really good metaphor. I think that's a really good metaphor. So, with doctors, the American Medical Association has, you know, lots of continuing education and reports on lots of different topics from various specialties. This type of thing is the same thing within IT. Okay, Thanks. Second round Councilwoman Kale Smith. Second round Councilwoman Kale Smith. Yeah, I just would like to know: did you ever take any classes or any help from Homeland Security? Have they ever come in Homeland Security? Mm-hmm, Because I know they offer a lot of free services. Yeah, we're partnered with them. Yes, And you still think this is necessary? Yes, absolutely Okay, All right, Thank you, I actually have somebody doing research so I'll get back to you on it. Any further discussion: Seeing none. all those in favor of Bill Smith: please raise your hand, Okay. Bill 1777. please indicate by saying aye, Aye, Abstain. One abstention. Affirmative recommendation. Thank you, Thank you.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

This is our version of that, but for Like and staying up on all of the different, not just trends, but all of the trends that are happening in the world.

• City council voted to hold a future public hearing on emergency response and power grid problems after recent widespread outages

• The hearing will focus on two main topics:
  - How the city responds to disasters and emergencies
  - Problems with the electric grid, including whether power lines should be buried underground

• Council members said these are separate issues that need different discussions - one about the city's emergency plans and another about Duquesne Light's power grid

• Residents across the city have been asking for underground power lines, which council wants to explore more

• Some residents who already had buried power lines still lost electricity during the recent outages, showing underground lines aren't a perfect solution

• The council will set a date for the hearing later since they have a busy schedule

• Council members mentioned they had previous discussions about these issues and want to make sure they're coordinated on their approach

• The hearing may be canceled or changed depending on how other emergency response work develops"
