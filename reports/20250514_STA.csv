I didn't mention his name, but I will now: Kareem Khan, chief prosecutor and diplomat of the International Criminal Court. Imagine that He's raping one of his employees, has done it repeatedly for months and they know about it and are protecting him because they think his position as a diplomat is more important than his position as a prosecutor. Really, I praise God I'm not near him. I remove his head in Jesus name, with all the love in my heart, that's what I would do to them. Lord, please return the sender and your voodoo. hex's curse sent towards me 100 million billion trillion Google clicks And whoever's sending it. Lord, please throw them into a lake of fire. We need to count our blessings. Thank you, Lord. I'm not this woman that this diplomat is raping, But to her I will say to you: Exodus 14. 14 says the Lord will fight for you. You need only to be still, Because that's what I have to be- for him to fight. all of you who know about what's going on with me, Why, when, how, everybody involved, where everything is that belongs to me, that has my real name on it. God blesses us so that we might bless others. in spite of everything that's happened to me, still happening to me, I will continue to fight to be a blessing.

Now, Ms Hardwick, I had a problem with you Whenever she brought the homeless white man that you, while she's up here talking, you went over to him and you did something and you went back and forth. I keep telling you when the people are talking and you're we're talking and trying to think We only got three minutes and then you do that. It's very distracting. And then, when Ms Smith was out here and her and the man was talking and the one man that comes in, he do seem like he's really angry And he had said: be quiet, The sergeant of arms automatically come to him. It should be. get Ms Smith and put her back where she supposed to be. There's supposed to be 90 men up here And then you got eight like Mr Codhill. he really thinks that he's something.

• Three residents spoke during public comment to address problems with how city council members behave during meetings

• Yvonne Brown, who lives in the Hill District, complained that council members are distracted when residents speak during their three-minute time limit

• Brown said council members use computers, tablets, and phones instead of listening to speakers, and talk among themselves while residents are speaking

• She called this behavior ""very disrespectful"" and compared it to students talking while a teacher is speaking

• Brown brought up concerns about homeless people, saying they have ""no one to turn to"" when mistreated by police

• She returned a cup and money belonging to a homeless person who she said lost these items because of police actions

• Brown also criticized specific council members for leaving their seats and being disruptive during public comment

• She asked council members to work together with residents to solve community problems, saying ""I know what's happening in my community""

• HP Jackson, representing the Black Political Empowerment Project, spoke about segregation issues in the city's education system

• The public comment period had no pre-registered speakers, so these residents spoke as walk-ups"

• The ordinance would create new rules for ""managed natural landscapes"" - planned gardens using plants native to Pennsylvania, including rain gardens, native gardens, and pollinator gardens

• Council Member Warwick, who sponsored the bill, asked for a two-week delay to gather more public input after the proposal made news and more residents wanted to share their opinions

• Warwick emphasized that any final rules must be simple, not complicated, for residents to follow

• The ordinance would require residents to register their natural landscapes with the city and follow specific rules, such as:
  - Using only native Pennsylvania plants
  - Creating clear borders around the garden areas
  - Avoiding invasive plant species
  - Not blocking public walkways or creating safety hazards

• If passed, the new rules would take effect on January 1, 2026

• The bill has support from six council members who are sponsoring or co-sponsoring it

• The delay allows more time for community feedback before the council makes a final decision"

So we need a motion to hold public hearing. We have a second. Is there a discussion? All I'll say is: I've heard about this park from the people who started it. It's a great community building project. I'm excited that the proposal is to make it official. Is this interrogatory? Is this in your district? Council Member. Yeah, it's like that tiny little sliver in Oakland. that's on Panther Hollow. I just cannot say enough. they spoke at an Oakland OPDC gathering community meeting a few months back and can't say enough good things about it. these Pitt students who have created a skate park out of such an empty park- and sorry, I know this is probably something you'll say later- but cannot support this project enough. oh, and I do also want to say a big shout out to Gary Shuley, who is the foreman for Shanley Park, because he is- He is a former skater. I don't know if he still skates, but he has been a big help in making it what it is. It's really cool if you ever go down there. All right, any further discussion Seeing none. all those in favor of holding Bill 1807 for a cable cast public hearing, please indicate by saying aye, Aye, Aye, Bill will be held.",Pittsburgh City Council schedules public hearing on renaming Boundary Street Park to honor student-built skate park.,"• Pittsburgh City Council voted to schedule a public hearing on renaming Boundary Street Park in Central Oakland to ""Oakland DIY Skatepark""

• The park was transformed by University of Pittsburgh students who built a skate park in what was previously an empty space

• Council Member Kale Smith, who represents the area, strongly supports the project and praised it as a great community building effort

• The students presented their project at a community meeting a few months ago, impressing local officials

• Gary Shuley, a foreman at Shanley Park and former skater, has helped the students develop the skate park

• The public hearing is scheduled for June 10, 2025, and will be broadcast on cable TV

• The city is rebuilding the old Downing Street steps in the 6th Ward, which were closed and removed

• The new steps will face downhill and extend about 2 feet onto Port Authority property

• The city needs an easement (permission to use) a small strip of Port Authority land for the new steps

• A council member said the current legal text was confusing and made it sound like the city would give the steps to Port Authority, which is not the plan

• The city will own and maintain the steps, but needs Port Authority's permission to build on their property

• The agreement would cost the city nothing

• Council will vote again next week after the legal language is corrected

• The steps will connect Hancock Street to Herron Avenue via Downing Street"

• Pittsburgh Water is required to accommodate city projects when their pipes and equipment are located under city streets

• PennDOT requires these cost-sharing agreements for projects that receive state grant money
