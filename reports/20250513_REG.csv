And whereas, while positive trends in job and wage growth are contributing to a strong and dynamic local economy in Pittsburgh, they are also placing upward pressure on prices, particularly for housing. and whereas empowering Pittsburgh to establish our own minimum wage policies would allow us to ensure that wage scales in our city reflect the economic realities that our residents face, prevent displacement and brain drain, encourage population growth within the city and help to secure critical workforce pipelines for our growing industries. And whereas, by calling for an increased wage, Pittsburgh is joining municipalities across the Commonwealth, including Philadelphia, Allentown and the City of Lancaster, which have passed resolutions in support of HB 1150. Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh hereby urges the Pennsylvania General Assembly to pass Representative Ronnie Green's legislation, HB 1150, to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. and be it further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh urges that any minimum wage legislation include an annual cost of living adjustment and grants municipalities local wage freedom by lifting state preemption on wages. and be it further resolved that a copy of this will of council will be distributed to the Allegheny County Delegations of the Pennsylvania State General Assembly and and to the office of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. May we have a motion to approve So moved. Second, Any discussion? Councilwoman Warburg. Yeah, so I just, you know, as far as the minimum wage goes. you know, every year I go to Alderdice and I talk to the seniors just about workforce development stuff And one of the first things that I ask them is who's working right, and most of them are, and I ask them how much they're making And I let them know that in this economy, no one should be making less than $15 an hour, right? So, minimum wage rules or not, And a lot of them are, And some of them are making as little as 10 something an hour. Some of them are making like almost 15 an hour. So I really feel like anybody who is paying less than $15 an hour right now- and I don't care who, you are right, Whether you're a small business owner or a giant corporation, or hiring a babysitter or hiring someone to do your lot like $15- if you're not paying at least at least $15 an hour in this economy, You are exploiting the person who is working for you. So you know this. and, of course, the fact that the minimum wage is seven something an hour in Pennsylvania. it's, you know, it's laughable, right? But the problem is that that enables that exploitation, right, By having such a low minimum wage. that enables you know businesses to. you know, when that 15 year old comes in looking for, you know, looking for- a job, it enables them to pay them that 11 dollars just because they don't know, right, maybe that they just don't realize what they should be making because they're just not as savvy, or if that's, you know, maybe someone, a, a newer immigrant to the, to the city, or something like that, just someone who isn't as savvy about what they should be making right or what that job should be paying, because they just don't have that kind of experience. so yeah, that's all. I'm just this. this seems like such a no-brainer to me, but I don't know, we'll see. we'll see what happens. so, thank you. thank you very much. any further discussion seeing none. all those in favor say aye, aye, aye. the will of council has been approved.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

I thought that the vote on the vegetation height ordinance was going on today, but it's just as well, So I'm gonna cut this short, If y'all will please read written testimony. that's coming. I'm Ed Renamdy from Swissville. I mean Swiss Elm Park, excuse me. So I sincerely appreciate the intent behind the amendment of the brief city code section about vegetation, aka noxious weed height, and thanks to Council Member Barb Warwick for being the primary sponsor, and I'd hope to speak with you before it comes up for a vote. However, after much thought, I now favor reconsidering this so that we'll have more time to work on a more comprehensive legislation that I would like to see passed later this year, no matter the vote on the amendment. Such a plan should rely primarily on education and support to encourage voluntary, beneficial changes. It would allow cooperation from our chapter of wild ones and the Pennsylvania native plant society. as I had mentioned before, both have sample ordinances. FIPS would be a great partner, as is the Audubon Society already. please contact me if you would like my help in bringing together expertise and I'll cut it off at this. please read the written testimony, thank you. thank you very much. that exhausts our list of registered speakers. will now take comments from those in chambers. if you're wishing to speak, please come forward at this time. provide your name and neighborhood for the record. you'll be given three minutes to speak. good morning, sorry, i'm late. my name is devin mclean. i grew up on the hill district, cliff street, befford avenue, francis court, off of wally. i like this thing you're doing with the lineup so i can actually see your faces. september 13th, friday, 2024. i was working a shift as a security guard out there where second avenue turns into greenfield avenue, you get on the eliza furnace trail right there. if you look at the trailhead, there's one of them things that the gas company does, with all valves sticking out and it's a fence around it. no smoking lights or open flame- i don't know what those are called, but a pump station. I'm gonna say for the sake of this situation. I was working a shift on a UPMC lot when at about 10: 30 pm I seen a guy walking- but I always see guys walking, you know, even though it's after dark and the trail closes after dark. I seen him walking and then boom, a 10-foot circle of lingering white smoke. This dude just set off a stick of dynamite. Now, had that explosion been about eight feet to the right, my co-worker who was in the security booth could have been seriously, fatally injured or jacked up if the glass broken went into her face. So I flashed a guy with my flashlight. Hey, you stop. Hey you stop. You there with the goatee. You there in the long hair, You there in the shorts. He didn't turn around until I started using racial epithets at him. What are you doing? What's your problem? Do you know where you're at? It's train track 60 yards to the right, a major highway 50 yards in front of you and a major gas line running under your feet. I forgot to tell you just now, halfway down the hill, When I got down the hill and around the corner, boom, another one. Police took me. Police took me to security guard in a full uniform- Chaos, Thank you. Next speaker, please. My name is Yvonne F Brown. I live at 715 Mercer Street up in the Hill District. Yesterday was Mother's Day.

I come down to try and stop the killings or even hurt someone getting harmed. now my daughter, unique, told me Keisha was having this. it's something like a timeshare, some kind of program, some kind of luncheon. so I go, and the host was talking about how she's traveling around the world and she spent so much money going to Jamaica in different places, so she had asked about where we had traveled. she asked me where did I travel? I said Jamaica. and then, And there was a young Jamaican fellow sitting there and he asked me where had I been? Well, my daughter goes all the time, I know. I went to Kingston and a lot of little villages, But I said, sir, I said, if you're from Jamaica, you know it's a mountain, a tall mountain that we went to And I believe it's in Kingston, And as you go up the walkway there's a statue. Well, what it was? it was a black Jamaican fell in love with a white woman and they had ran away and they ran to this mountain and they're telling him to come down. you're not going to be in any trouble at all, You're not going to be. But they jumped off the mountain together and killed themselves. So I turned to him. I said, sir, you're from Jamaica, what mountain is that? And he says, oh, I don't know. See, this is what I'm trying to tell you. He's from Jamaica and I'm telling him his history. You can't know everything that's happened in my community And if I don't tell you, you won't know. I come down because Pateek is running for judge and he came up to our building- Well, I don't care for him because he didn't treat me right when I went to court, when I got jumped on And he spoke to me and I said: you know, I don't really wanna talk to you, but I will tell you that the policeman said you and Arbor are dropping the ball with Rashida and her mother in this building. Okay, as I'm talking, we have the campaign manager. the building is a woman that's been living there for years. she interrupts and takes them away from me. the same way, when i was trying to talk to the mayor, this woman thinks she opens, she thinks she owns that room and they let her do that too, because the last time i challenged her why i couldn't speak loud and make an announcement, they called west recycle on me. yes, thank you very much. next speaker, please, it's a lot y'all. good morning. special agent sunshine.

I have to protect myself from this voodoo, you guys, because y'all do it. Last time I was here, I talked about the $100 million that PRT is in deficit. Where'd it go, IRS, please? It's called an audit. We're going to fine every dime And if it's in Hawaii, Aruba, Paris, maybe trips around the world. really, Do you think the state is going to grant you this $117 million increase and a $0. 25 rate increase? Really, For you to blow again? you will not. 2 Corinthians 4. 18 says: While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, For the things which are seen are temporal, like you guys, Temporary- you will not always be here- But the things which are not seen are eternal, like the children. for the next three generations They're eternal. They'll be here. We will not, And I'm standing here for them. I will protect them with my life against diplomats who think it's okay to rape women. Let me explain something to you. It is not. women need to come together for men's heads, penises and testicles to think it's okay to rape us. It is not. I don't care what your position is, king, I don't care.

We have to fight as women against it, And he denies it Really. Proverbs 19: 9: I will keep screaming until somebody hears me.

It is not, And we need to fight As women. I'm standing here for all of them, Every woman that's ever been raped in Jesus' name I stand for. And it's a no, the N and the O. When we say no, we mean it, I don't care what your position is. And for the woman this is being done to, please do not live in fear. Fight against this man that's raping you repeatedly, month after month, And they know about it and they're protecting this man because his position as a diplomat is more important. really, Is his head as important? And I ask every woman that's been raped: is it? Come for it, because I will, And I'm not playing with none of y'all about any man raping a woman. We have to fight as women against it, And he denies it Really. Proverbs 19: 9: I will keep screaming until somebody hears me. A false witness will not go unpunished and a liar will be destroyed. and if you think God is playing about destroying liars, we gonna see what happened in this one, in Jesus name. next speaker, please. next speaker, please see you. no further speakers will turn to the presentation of papers, beginning with councilman Charlene.","City council hears public comments on vegetation ordinance delays, trail explosion incident, and transit funding concerns.","**City Council Public Comments Cover Multiple Community Concerns**

• **Vegetation ordinance delayed for more work**: Edward Wrenn from Swiss Elm Park asked council to postpone voting on a proposed law about plant and weed height limits. He wants more time to create better rules that focus on teaching people rather than punishing them. He suggested working with local nature groups like Wild Ones and the Pennsylvania Native Plant Society.

• **Explosion reported near Eliza Furnace Trail**: Devin McClain, who grew up in the Hill District, told council about a dangerous incident on September 13th. While working security, he saw someone set off what appeared to be dynamite near a gas station and major roadways around 10:30 PM. He said a second explosion happened shortly after and worried someone could have been seriously hurt.

• **Transit funding questioned**: A speaker called ""Special Agent Sunshine"" criticized the Port Authority's request for $117 million in additional funding and a 25-cent fare increase. She questioned where a previous $100 million went and called for an audit of the transit agency's spending.

• **Community safety concerns raised**: Hill District resident Yvonne Brown spoke about ongoing violence in her neighborhood and her efforts to prevent harm to residents. She also mentioned issues with a judicial candidate and building management problems.

• **One speaker gave unclear remarks**: Dr. Ronald Miller spoke about various topics including international bridges and chemical elements, but his comments were difficult to follow."

Sheridan needs some attention for the kids, but Esplin also needs some attention to for some of the things they have. it's a small area and it borders McKees rocks. a lot of people want to climb over Esplin here to get to the Sheridan part or go over to McKees rocks and I just want to make sure that. but that's always on somebody's radar. That's it, thank you. They're waiting for a new playground there, that's all, Thank you. Thank you, I've got Councilman Gross and Councilman Strasburger. I appreciate Councilwoman Smith thanking our Parks and Rec Department and it makes me remember how hard she and I fought to raise the wages for lifeguards as well as other members, And, as a reminder, it is also recruiting for lifeguard season. so if you're out there and looking for summer employment, the lifeguard wages now range from $17. 48 an hour to $20. 16 an hour- And you go to good tan. we should, too, take that job. It's a great job for people across the city and so we encourage you. that includes if you're not a certified lifeguard. if you can sign up now, you still have the window to have free certification during as part of your training. And there's number on and what I can read. the number allowed its 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 8, which is great news. And while I'm at it, I'm just literally reading from the city parks Twitter feed. So you guys are doing a good job on the app that used to be called Twitter. The call that I often get in my office is: when are the vouchers for seniors being distributed for the farmers market season? and the day I have on my calendar is that the healthy, active living center senior centers across the city. on Tuesday, June 10th, from 9 am to 12 pm they're going to. in the afternoon, from 1 to 3, you can pick up your vouchers for the seat farmers markets. So, thank you, appreciate a reminder that it's pool season again and it's lifeguard season again, and we're grateful to the parks and rec department, thank you. thank you, councilman, thank you. i'd like to make a motion to call for a post agenda hearing on the annual comprehensive financial report. second, all those in favor say aye, aye, any opposed? we'll work with your office and the clerk to get that scheduled. anything else from members? if not? i just want to take two seconds and thank you all for your vote some months ago now on the trade for manchester chateau. i paid attention, you didn't, but the final vote was actually cast by the county last week and they approved it as well. but it started here and made it through the school district. we actually had a community meeting in manchester yesterday about. it focused specifically on housing and how the housing opportunity fund and all the housing, the bond and all of that is spread across the city. but now we have an opportunity to do something specific for that neighborhood. so it was a good and productive meeting. but i want to thank you all for your vote on that and helping move that forward. i saw some other. i just want to say something real quickly about that. i- i you know- always admired how you handle things so calmly and just really a matter of factly. and i watched you in one of those meetings in my office, meeting with people about the farm and some of the things, and you just handled it so professionally and so amazing and i just want to thank you for that, because i think people don't see you behind of scenes and what you do and i think if they had seen that they would have also appreciated how you handled it. so i just want to thank you for that. thank you and congratulate you on getting an adult passion. thank you, councilman. yeah, no, i just wanted to echo councilwoman kale smith's sentiments. i watched them do it in the lower hill, i think for the most part with the those properties there, the sca properties, city properties, ura properties, all that stuff. but but you managed to please, i think for the most part, the lower hill district and i'm glad to see that, with the people from manchester too. i thought they were really great coming in here and, you know, showing that they wanted your attention and you gave it to them. so thanks, thank you.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

The call that I often get in my office is: when are the vouchers for seniors being distributed for the farmers market season? and the day I have on my calendar is that the healthy, active living center senior centers across the city. on Tuesday, June 10th, from 9 am to 12 pm they're going to. in the afternoon, from 1 to 3, you can pick up your vouchers for the seat farmers markets. So, thank you, appreciate a reminder that it's pool season again and it's lifeguard season again, and we're grateful to the parks and rec department, thank you. thank you, councilman, thank you. i'd like to make a motion to call for a post agenda hearing on the annual comprehensive financial report. second, all those in favor say aye, aye, any opposed? we'll work with your office and the clerk to get that scheduled. anything else from members? if not? i just want to take two seconds and thank you all for your vote some months ago now on the trade for manchester chateau. i paid attention, you didn't, but the final vote was actually cast by the county last week and they approved it as well. but it started here and made it through the school district. we actually had a community meeting in manchester yesterday about. it focused specifically on housing and how the housing opportunity fund and all the housing, the bond and all of that is spread across the city. but now we have an opportunity to do something specific for that neighborhood. so it was a good and productive meeting. but i want to thank you all for your vote on that and helping move that forward. i saw some other. i just want to say something real quickly about that. i- i you know- always admired how you handle things so calmly and just really a matter of factly. and i watched you in one of those meetings in my office, meeting with people about the farm and some of the things, and you just handled it so professionally and so amazing and i just want to thank you for that, because i think people don't see you behind of scenes and what you do and i think if they had seen that they would have also appreciated how you handled it. so i just want to thank you for that. thank you and congratulate you on getting an adult passion. thank you, councilman. yeah, no, i just wanted to echo councilwoman kale smith's sentiments. i watched them do it in the lower hill, i think for the most part with the those properties there, the sca properties, city properties, ura properties, all that stuff. but but you managed to please, i think for the most part, the lower hill district and i'm glad to see that, with the people from manchester too. i thought they were really great coming in here and, you know, showing that they wanted your attention and you gave it to them. so thanks, thank you.",City Council approves motion to hold public hearing on Pittsburgh's annual financial report.,"• City Council approved a motion to hold a public hearing on Pittsburgh's Annual Comprehensive Financial Report
