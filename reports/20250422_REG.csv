We have lots to celebrate. Can I have everyone from Fair Housing up for Fair Housing Month? Appreciate it? We have so much good work and so many important issues in front of Council all at the same time, especially in this time, I think, nationally, where we are kind of feeling, I think, our responsibility as local governments to doing what we, as our jurisdiction, and our responsibility to do in the jurisdictions that we represent.

It is more important than ever, considering the state of fair housing across the country. We don't take for granted that we as a commission are still in good standing and able to do the work that we do every day, because you all put your faith in us to do that. So thank you. And with me today I have our commission staff. I want to thank them as well, because they come to the table every day ready to fight for fair housing. They it's not just a month, It's not just a day, It's every day with my staff. So I just thank you for the work that you do. Housing is a human right. We hear that a lot these days, but what do we mean when we say that? What comes after the slogan? Yes, stable housing is the most important prerequisite for us to thrive and build a decent life. But deeper than that, housing is one of our most basic survival needs. The things that we all need to survive aren't conveniences, They aren't gifts, They're essentials. Controlling access to housing is a powerful tool to keep people away from opportunity. Mayor David Lawrence understood this When, in 1958, he signed the Fair Housing Practices Ordinance for the city of Pittsburgh and entrusted the Human Relations Commission with enforcing those practices. President Johnson understood this 10 years later when he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, And this is still understood today by those in Washington, in Harrisburg and here in the city who want to frustrate the city and overcome the AKD, the mission of fair housing advocates, and end equal access to housing. President Johnson's signature on the Fair Housing Act capped a decade of work from Dr Martin Luther King Jr. It was signed into law one week after Dr King's death and the demonstrations ensued. We should be reminded of the high price paid for equality and fairness in housing And in a way, we are reminded of that now. Today we stand against efforts unseen for decades to attack and undermine basic fair housing rights. We choose to stand with those who came before, who fought, suffered and, yes, died to establish the right of fair housing, regardless of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation or any other circumstance that is beyond their control.

First of all, thank you, President and council members, for letting Reading is Fundamental Pittsburgh be a part of this amazing event. Our mission at RIF is to ensure that all kids in the Pittsburgh community have access to books and resources to motivate them to develop a love of reading, and in the past year we provided almost eighty four thousand books on the north side, the south side, the Hill District. Fazon, or Pittsburgh Faison, is the school at Homewood that we serve in Hazelwood and in Wilkinsburg, And my work specifically is in our mentoring program Rip- Everybody Wins, where we match volunteers to read for an hour a week with kids at Pittsburgh Faison in Homewood, at Pittsburgh Weill in the Hill District and at Pittsburgh King on the north side, as well as Manchester Academic Charter School. So today I would just like to reiterate the importance of having adults in kids' lives and the power that reading has to let kids learn more about themselves and learn more about the world. We like to say that books provide windows and mirrors for kids. They can see themselves reflected and their specialness and their importance shown on the page, while also learning about others in our community and in our community. So if you would be interested in reading for an hour a week with kids in one of our schools, we have over 200 mentors this year. I would love to serve more kids next year. You can visit our website, riffpittsburghorg slash mentoring or you can come see me or my colleague Corey and we'll give you a card. But thank you for letting us be part of this event and thank you to everyone in this room for what you do to support the kids here in Pittsburgh. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

In the name of the school, we would like to sincerely thank the City of Pittsburgh for officially declaring April 22: 2025: Take a Father to School Day in the City of Pittsburgh. This declaration is so much more than an allocation of representation for our school district. It is a reminder that fathers in the City of Pittsburgh, specifically in Pittsburgh Public Schools, do show up and are genuinely committed and invested in the academic achievement of our students. We thank the forefathers who were committed enough to displaying the fact that fathers are actually engaged in their child's lives. We thank the City of Pittsburgh for bringing light to a life-changing initiative and, most importantly, on behalf of Pittsburgh Public Schools, we want to thank all the fathers who consistently show up and have made this day possible for 27 years. I think that deserves a round of applause. On behalf of Pittsburgh Public Schools, I declare that Take a Father to School Day will live on forever. Thank you all. Thank you, Chief of Staff Blackwell. We really appreciate it. Now, Mr President, he's going to come and share some things, but before Mr President comes, I want to take a moment to say thank you to you and to members of Council for opening the doors each and every year for us.

And so how do you do it? Just one step at a time, And so we appreciate you guys, members of Council, for allowing us to come here. Mr President, Thank you. This will take all two seconds, but we'll have to read the end of it so we can formally dedicate the 20 seconds Now. therefore, it be resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh, the City of Pittsburgh and the City of Pittsburgh, all members of Council, the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby commend the thousands who participate and urge the entire Pittsburgh school district community to actively participate in this worthwhile event, and be it further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby declare April 22, 2025 to be Take a Father to School Day in the City of Pittsburgh. So, moved Second, All those in favor say aye, Aye, Congratulations, Thank you, Thank you. And in closing, we want to remember the history of the PTA. Thank you.

Spend the time in the libraries, Take a child and read, read and read. Now we're going to close with our hands and our fist ball. Before we close, I saw Councilman Moore wants to give a comment. Yes, sir, Yes, sir, Yes, I do. I just quickly. I want to thank everyone here so much for being here, Also the women of Alpha, Kappa, Alpha. So just today, I you know, while you're all still here, because I know you know so. today we're celebrating Take a Father to School Day, We're celebrating the women of Alpha Kappa Alpha, We are celebrating Fair Housing Month And we are celebrating National Community Development Week. And just for the folks in this room, I want briefly to acknowledge some mailers that came to many of your mailboxes over the Easter weekend. Campaigns are campaigns, Politics is politics, So I'm not going to comment on that. However, the implications that 30 years of purposeful neglect and disinvestment in Black communities is the fault or legacy of our first Black mayor is appalling. Attacking the mayor's wife is appalling. Saying that contracts that were awarded to two Black women led organizations that went through the legal, fully vetted RFP process were somehow not transparent or somehow sweetheart deals feeds into the anti-black, anti-inclusion and anti-DEI rhetoric that we are seeing all over the country. It's shameful and I am embarrassed and I feel the need to apologize on behalf of our entire city government. to be quite frank, But I do wanna say that, given this room, all of you, you all worked so hard, you all worked so hard for the betterment of your communities and I want you to know that Pittsburgh sees that, Despite of what's in the media, despite of nasty mailers like this. there are so many people around this city. We see that we recognize that, And so I just wanna thank you all so much for being here today and for all the amazing work that you do. thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for our chair, But I gotta tell you, councilwoman, as young folks would say, I felt that Thank you. All. right, we're gonna hold just our fist ball in here to show our determination for educating our children and volunteering, and we're just gonna say our cheer. When I say Pittsburgh, you say fathers, And each time you go louder, we do it three times: Pittsburgh Fathers, Pittsburgh Fathers, Pittsburgh Fathers. Thank you, members of council, Thank you, Thank you. Can you guys get in closer together? Come up, you can come to the front here. I'm short, I'm gonna get everybody into. No, I'm gonna take over. hey, councilwoman, come with me. sis, please come with me. nobody, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna. we would like to present to the first person who arrived the signed autograph wall number 51. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

First of all, thank you, President and council members, for letting Reading is Fundamental Pittsburgh be a part of this amazing event. Our mission at RIF is to ensure that all kids in the Pittsburgh community have access to books and resources to motivate them to develop a love of reading, and in the past year we provided almost eighty four thousand books on the north side, the south side, the Hill District. Fazon, or Pittsburgh Faison, is the school at Homewood that we serve in Hazelwood and in Wilkinsburg, And my work specifically is in our mentoring program Rip- Everybody Wins, where we match volunteers to read for an hour a week with kids at Pittsburgh Faison in Homewood, at Pittsburgh Weill in the Hill District and at Pittsburgh King on the north side, as well as Manchester Academic Charter School. So today I would just like to reiterate the importance of having adults in kids' lives and the power that reading has to let kids learn more about themselves and learn more about the world. We like to say that books provide windows and mirrors for kids. They can see themselves reflected and their specialness and their importance shown on the page, while also learning about others in our community and in our community. So if you would be interested in reading for an hour a week with kids in one of our schools, we have over 200 mentors this year. I would love to serve more kids next year. You can visit our website, riffpittsburghorg slash mentoring or you can come see me or my colleague Corey and we'll give you a card.

In the name of the school, we would like to sincerely thank the City of Pittsburgh for officially declaring April 22: 2025: Take a Father to School Day in the City of Pittsburgh.

It is a reminder that fathers in the City of Pittsburgh, specifically in Pittsburgh Public Schools, do show up and are genuinely committed and invested in the academic achievement of our students. We thank the forefathers who were committed enough to displaying the fact that fathers are actually engaged in their child's lives. We thank the City of Pittsburgh for bringing light to a life-changing initiative and, most importantly, on behalf of Pittsburgh Public Schools, we want to thank all the fathers who consistently show up and have made this day possible for 27 years.

Now, Mr President, he's going to come and share some things, but before Mr President comes, I want to take a moment to say thank you to you and to members of Council for opening the doors each and every year for us.

And so how do you do it? Just one step at a time, And so we appreciate you guys, members of Council, for allowing us to come here. Mr President, Thank you.

Spend the time in the libraries, Take a child and read, read and read. Now we're going to close with our hands and our fist ball. Before we close, I saw Councilman Moore wants to give a comment. Yes, sir, Yes, sir, Yes, I do. I just quickly. I want to thank everyone here so much for being here, Also the women of Alpha, Kappa, Alpha. So just today, I you know, while you're all still here, because I know you know so. today we're celebrating Take a Father to School Day, We're celebrating the women of Alpha Kappa Alpha, We are celebrating Fair Housing Month And we are celebrating National Community Development Week. And just for the folks in this room, I want briefly to acknowledge some mailers that came to many of your mailboxes over the Easter weekend. Campaigns are campaigns, Politics is politics, So I'm not going to comment on that. However, the implications that 30 years of purposeful neglect and disinvestment in Black communities is the fault or legacy of our first Black mayor is appalling. Attacking the mayor's wife is appalling. Saying that contracts that were awarded to two Black women led organizations that went through the legal, fully vetted RFP process were somehow not transparent or somehow sweetheart deals feeds into the anti-black, anti-inclusion and anti-DEI rhetoric that we are seeing all over the country. It's shameful and I am embarrassed and I feel the need to apologize on behalf of our entire city government. to be quite frank, But I do wanna say that, given this room, all of you, you all worked so hard, you all worked so hard for the betterment of your communities and I want you to know that Pittsburgh sees that, Despite of what's in the media, despite of nasty mailers like this. there are so many people around this city. We see that we recognize that, And so I just wanna thank you all so much for being here today and for all the amazing work that you do. thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for our chair, But I gotta tell you, councilwoman, as young folks would say, I felt that Thank you. All. right, we're gonna hold just our fist ball in here to show our determination for educating our children and volunteering, and we're just gonna say our cheer. When I say Pittsburgh, you say fathers, And each time you go louder, we do it three times: Pittsburgh Fathers, Pittsburgh Fathers, Pittsburgh Fathers. Thank you, members of council, Thank you, Thank you. Can you guys get in closer together? Come up, you can come to the front here. I'm short, I'm gonna get everybody into. No, I'm gonna take over. hey, councilwoman, come with me. sis, please come with me. nobody, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna. we would like to present to the first person who arrived the signed autograph wall number 51.

They asked him why he resigned. He said: listen, I've been the first on a few occasions, but never once have I been a token and I won't start now. But one thing he did accomplish was he had East Hills Park, which is probably one of the most beautiful community parks, finished and built up in East Hills. So he was very proud of that, because the kids up there didn't have anywhere to play. So I'm really honored to be able to get, And I'm really honored to be able to continue to push his legacy forward through the work of the Chuck Cooper Foundation. I started that organization back in 2013. Since then we've awarded 400,000 in scholarships and we outreach to thousands of kids to our Beacons of Light outreach program.

I saw those flyers that came out and I was disgusted with it. I did the research a couple weeks ago and the backers of Cory O'Connor, as I had stated before, spend a lot too much time in and out of court. I also researched the developers that have backed Mayor Ganey. The typical docket entries are no lien agreements, which is very common. if you're a contractor, That's what you expect. Nothing that would jump out at anybody going through the dockets. Now these attacks- yes, attacks on people who Mayor Ganey may know, or his wife may know, or females, or anything of that nature- kudos. to him That means he's hiring, or he knows, reputable people that don't spend all their time in dockets. And then you have the docket line at the county. There's a big difference. So what if it's all women? So what if they're friends of the mayor that are reputable and do good work and don't spend all their time in the docket entry line at the prothonotary's office? The mayor has done great things in this city. I look forward to this next debate. It seems like we're no longer Democratic and Republican. Now there's a third party in there- Trumpsters, And it's just a level that is disgusting, And still to this day. after I was called a nimby because a lot of Corey's backers are underappreciated, I called him under Sequoiare, which is a defined definition of NIMBY and that indicates nameless people. I had to turn to Mrs May about this. reduces stuff after ladyB0a Energizer to have no plan out who's going to be the mayor. I had to turn to Mrs May Olson, who takes the lead in this, for having a clean, reputable, not a name calling, not throwing things at each other, just a standout man, thank you. Thank you very much. next speaker, please? My name is Yvonne F Burns and I live at 715 Mercer Street up in the Hill District. I wanted to address you, Ms Hardwick. You brought out about, I think, a picture like this for the housing supposed to be that Mayor Ganey is not taking care of the community like he should. I came down because I saw a picture of where they have Mayor Ganey as black as coal and they're saying about supposed to be money from the affordable housing. but I thought when to do, though? even when Luke left, there was questions about that money. Money was being was missing then, And then, when they changed mayorship, there was actually trucks that were stolen. They disappeared. You didn't hear nothing about that. but now you all, you're all trying to blame it on Ganey. I don't care for Ganey, but the truth is this: If you're gonna tell the truth, that's what you do. Don't make it like he's such a sinister man. They made him real black. that's supposed to be? Put fear in you when you're black fear. That's what they did with his picture. I know what they're doing. I've seen it. I went to college. I studied psychology. I may get up here and you may think that I don't know, but I do know a lot. I went to college. Anytime they had something that was a free class I went to. I wanna know. I wanna know what's happening in the world. I want to be treated the same as everybody else. I wanna make sure that I get what you get. My children, my grandchildren get the same. I have lived. in July I will be 79 years old. I have lived a long time. I have come down here over 20 something years. I have watched things, I have learned things. I have learned. I have seen things. I have seen your ways. I have seen you while I'm talking and anybody else. you're talking amongst yourself. You're on the phone, You're on the computer. The young white girl: when she came up she was a little the same as I am. She came up and she said I wasn't gonna speak. She said: but I watched you And she was angry. She said: these people come down to speak and you're on your phone, you're on your computers, you're on this, you're on that. Do you understand that? this woman, this young child- I can't say young child, She's about 17 or 18- But she knows what our civil duty is. Our civil duty is to tell you what we need. You can't know if you don't live in my neighborhood. You can't know that we don't have transportation to get down to the bottom of the hill, to the hospital. But when we have a meeting about the police, Ms Gross and the president will make the decision that we have to go to Lawrenceville two buses to be able to speak what we want to say. But we can take one bus to go right down here, But to speak we gotta come to her neighborhood. Thank you very much. Forgive me. forgive me to do better. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ms Brown. Next speaker, please. Good morning, David Tessitore Banksville. 35 years ago to this morning, an event kicked off at Point State Park with Native American ceremony at daybreak. By the end of the day, we were told 75,000 people had come to the 20th anniversary of Earth Day. And this being Earth Day, I made sure I came to speak. In the years I should point out that I was one of the organizers. There were 60 members of the coalition. My organization that I was the executive director of at the time was in charge of all the children's programming. We sought to call attention to the Earth, celebrate what we had. In the years since then I have fought most of my time trying to challenge the primary threat to both the city and the natural environment, and that is real estate speculation. A few years after that we were told that southwestern Pennsylvania had the third highest rate of land consumption in the country, with a continuing decline of population, And that was from suburban sprawl. The number one existential threat to this city is real estate speculation. Now we've had comment about the mayoral race and the funding being by a lot of real estate speculators, but it goes back a long ways, back to the 1980s when the airport area was designated to be the new central business district. Want to know why the city has been going down? Because many of your predecessors and maybe some of yourselves have made decisions which have enabled that to happen And it's continuing. Evidently they aren't quite satisfied, so they're dumping lots of money into this mayoral race. But we have seen This city is the furthest away from its airport, I think, of any of the major cities And I think of the major metropolitan areas, we're the only one not connected by rail, And yet that's supposed to be the new downtown. So what we have seen happen- I saw it back in the 80s when Volkwines moved out- I said, ah, I see what's happening. So I do hope, and I hope, to come before you to address more on this issue. but real estate speculation- and the voters will have a chance to speak about that themselves- is the number one existential threat to this city. I thank you. Thank you, Next speaker, please. Next speaker, please. Seeing no further speakers. we'll turn to the presentation of papers, beginning with Councilman Sharland, chair of human resources. No new papers, Mr President. Thank you, Councilman Coghill, chair of public safety and wellness. No new papers, Mr President. Thank you, Councilman Gross, chair of innovation, performance, asset management and technology.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

• The bill, sponsored by Council Member Warwick, creates rules for ""managed natural landscapes"" that include rain gardens, native plant gardens, and pollinator gardens designed to help butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds.

• Residents would be allowed to plant any native Pennsylvania plants, but cannot use invasive species or plants that the state considers weeds.

• Property owners must register their natural landscapes with the city and provide either a detailed plan showing what plants they'll use and where, or certification from groups like the Audubon Society.

• The natural areas must have clear borders made of mowed grass, fencing up to 4 feet tall, or natural materials so neighbors can see where the garden begins and ends.

• The city can still require residents to cut down plants if they attract pests or rodents, and the gardens cannot block public walkways or create safety hazards.

• If approved, the new rules would take effect on January 1, 2026, and the city may charge a registration fee to cover program costs.

• The bill was sent to the Committee on Land Use and Economic Development for further review."

and bill number 1771 ordinance amending the Pittsburgh City Code, title 10, building. chapter 10 oh four- international property maintenance code- adoption- section 10 oh 402- changes specified to allow for the planting and maintenance of managed natural landscapes by residents",Pittsburgh City Council introduces ordinance to let residents plant natural landscapes without violating weed height rules.,"• Pittsburgh City Council introduced an ordinance that would let residents plant and maintain natural landscapes on their property without breaking current weed height rules.

• The bill, sponsored by Council Member Warwick, changes the city's property maintenance code to create an exception for ""managed natural landscapes.""

• Under current rules, property owners must keep weeds and plant growth under 10 inches tall or face violations and fines.

• The new ordinance would allow taller native plants and grasses as long as they qualify as ""managed natural landscapes"" as defined in city code.

• This change would let residents create more natural yards with native plants that often grow taller than the current 10-inch limit.

• The ordinance has been sent to the Committee on Land Use and Economic Development for review before any final vote.

• The change only applies to planned natural landscaping - regular weeds would still need to be kept under 10 inches tall."

• The property owner does not support making their building a historic structure, which will likely limit what changes they can make to the property.

• Two city groups that reviewed the proposal - the Historic Review Commission and City Planning Commission - both recommended against the historic designation.

• The nomination was originally submitted by Elizabeth Anderson and Matthew Cotter, not the property owner.

• City Council held public hearings to gather input from residents and other interested people before making their final decision.

• The designation will not cost the city any money, but it means the building will be protected under the city's historic preservation rules.

• The building is located in the Polish Hill neighborhood in Pittsburgh's 5th Ward."

and we have one sponsored bill and bill number 1772 resolution amending and supplementing the rules of council to provide for the contingent presiding officers over regular meetings of Council in the event of absences. thank you very much.",Council member proposes new rules to automatically assign committee chairs as backup meeting leaders when president and vice president are absent.,"**Council Proposes New System for Backup Meeting Leaders**

• Council Member Lavelle introduced a resolution to change how meetings are run when the main leaders are absent

• Currently, if both the Council President and President Pro-Tempore (vice president) can't attend a meeting, council members must vote to pick a temporary leader during the meeting

• The new rule would automatically assign backup leaders in a specific order instead of requiring a vote

• Committee chairs would take over as meeting leaders in this order:
  - Finance and Law Committee chair goes first
  - Public Safety Services Committee chair goes second  
  - Public Works and Infrastructure Committee chair goes third
  - Human Resources Committee chair goes fourth

• The resolution was introduced and sent to the Finance and Law Committee for review

• This change requires officially updating the Council's Rules, which set the procedures for how meetings work"

So, and my point is, we're not going to be able to get the ambulance to the hospital, So we're going to have to get the ambulance to the hospital. We're going to have to get the ambulance to the hospital, We're going to have to get the ambulance to the hospital. So I think again, I think that the point is, if you'll remember, I think two years ago, come this, come May Two years ago, I had a post agenda on the entire fleet, Specifically the entire fleet, But this has prompted me to want to call it another post agenda to schedule another post agenda, Just really focused solely around public safety. I think we'll do it around EMS, fire and police. We'll leave public works and the others out of it for now. I think we'll do it around EMS, fire and police. We'll leave public works and the others out of it for now. But one of the things I'm going to have to act on is whether or not we're able to do a shift on the aftercare and then, if we can get these efforts, I think we can get them back on board, as we do. but, but those three, because they're life-saving departments, that, and i'm truly really concerned about the fleet overall, and i just want to hear from the directors again and see what kind of what the state is. since, two years ago, being on the equipment leasing authority board, i can tell you it's not much better because we have not made the infusion of cash that we need there. so so, but but but i just want to hear from them personally, and you know i know a lot of people are concerned about it, and when i hear stories like that- which happened, i believe, just a couple days ago- it piques my concern. so so, with that, i'd like to schedule a post agenda around public safety, specifically ems, police and fire. thank you, is there a second sir? all in favor? say aye, hi, hi, we'll work with the clerk to get that. thank you, anything else from council president? yes, so i can't raise my hand in the virtual option, but thanks for calling me. i wanted to just recognize councilwoman cal smith. thanks for the speedy recovery note, much appreciated. everything's going well and just so the public knows that it's non-life-threatening to the public set. but it is something i just want to take care of for my health. so thank you, thank you everyone. i just wanted to also thank councilmember cog hill, because you know i appreciate his leadership in terms of the attention to public safety as public safety chair and calling for this post agenda. i hope we can have this sooner or later. you know, given the the circumstances that you know what you just heard from him, you know, hopefully sometime next week we can get this scheduled. you know, i believe it's more of an emergency than anything else. it's about time we have this conversation out in the open. we had it at the budget hearing, but it deserves another, another look behind the curtain here, because when ambulances are breaking down on the way to call something. that's seriously wrong. that's just not bad luck. that's the lack of investments, investment in, in, basically the basics. so, you know, i believe in our ems crews. they're out there doing their jobs, giving everything they got. least we can do is give them the equipment that works. if you know, if you drop a truck for a living, you know, like my dad did, you need that truck to run. so same goes for ambulances. we've kicked this, this, this can down the road. you know far enough about replacing these rigs. so, looking forward to catching up on this conversation, and the public's the one that's gonna, you know, pay the price in the end if we don't fix it. so i'm backing this post agenda because i i believe we owe it to the people who call now on one and the professionals who show up to help. so, looking forward to not, you know, stop patching things up and let's start fixing them right. thanks, thank you. any other member?

• Councilman Coghill requested the meeting after learning that a second ambulance had to be sent when the first one broke down either on the way to or at the emergency scene

• This is the second time in two years that Coghill has called for a meeting about the city's vehicle fleet problems, saying the situation has not improved much since then

• The council voted to focus specifically on public safety departments (police, fire, and EMS) rather than all city vehicles because these are ""life-saving departments""

• Council President Wilson supported the meeting, calling it ""more of an emergency than anything else"" and saying the city needs to stop just patching equipment and start fixing problems properly

• Wilson said the lack of working equipment puts both the public and emergency workers at risk, comparing it to needing a reliable truck for any job

• The council hopes to schedule the special meeting as soon as next week to address what they see as a lack of investment in basic emergency equipment"
